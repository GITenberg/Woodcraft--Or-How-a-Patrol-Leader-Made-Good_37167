<div class='center'><span class='big'><b><span class="smcap">The Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts</span></b></span></div>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SERIES OF BOOKS FOR BOYS</div>

<div class="center">Which, in addition to the interesting boy scout stories by CAPTAIN ALAN
DOUGLAS, Scoutmaster, contain articles on nature lore, native animals
and a fund of other information pertaining to out-of-door life,
that will appeal to the boy's love of the open.</div>


<div class="unindent"><b>I. The Campfires of the Wolf Patrol</b></div>

<p>Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities to use
their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way. Elmer <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chenoweth'">Chenowith</ins>, a lad
from the northwest woods, astonishes everyone by his familiarity with camp
life. A clean, wholesome story every boy should read.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br /><b>II. Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good</b></div>

<p>This tale presents many stirring situations in which some of the boys are called
upon to exercise all their ingenuity and unselfishness. A story filled with
healthful excitement.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br /><b>III. Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot</b></div>

<p>Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to the credit
of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast, one after the other.</p>


<div class='unindent'><br /><b>IV. Fast Nine; or, a Challenge From Fairfield</b></div>

<div class='blockquot'>They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The description of the
final game with the team of a rival town, and the outcome thereof, form a
stirring narrative. One of the best baseball stories of recent years.</div>


<div class='unindent'><br /><b>V. Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop</b></div>

<div class='blockquot'>After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest undertaking.
Their march takes them far from home, and the good-natured rivalry of the
different patrols furnishes many interesting and amusing situations.</div>


<div class='unindent'><br /><b>VI. Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day</b></div>

<div class='blockquot'>Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of apparent
failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and surprise their most
ardent admirers. One of the best stories Captain Douglas has written.</div>

HOW A PATROL LEADER MADE GOOD.</h2>




<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TWO SCOUTS IN A STORM.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Crashes</span> of thunder, sounding like the roll of heavy artillery
in battle, echoed through the forest some miles
above the town of Hickory Ridge on an August day.</p>

<p>Overhead, black, sullen clouds had covered the heavens,
and at any moment now the ominous stillness of the
woods might give way to the rushing sound of the wild
wind, together with a downpour of rain.</p>

<p>Two half-grown lads, dressed in the usual khaki costume
recognized as the official uniform of the Boy Scouts of
America, were standing there in the midst of the heavy
growth, casting uneasy looks around them.</p>

<p>It is one thing to watch the coming of a furious storm
from the windows of one's home, and quite another to be
caught napping, miles away from shelter. And the smaller
of the comrades had a frightened look on his face.</p>

<p>"My goodness! hear that, will you, Larry?" exclaimed
this rather timid fellow, as he instinctively caught hold
of his more sturdy comrade's sleeve, when a particularly
fierce flash of lightning was succeeded by a terrific crash.
"Ain't you going to find a hollow tree somewhere, and
climb in? Why, we'll get soaked to the skin if we don't
look out, I tell you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon you're about right there, Jasper," replied the
other, Larry Billings by name; and he made a wry face
while speaking. "But then, you see, there are some things
worse than getting wet, and being struck by lightning happens
to be one of the same. Excuse me, if you please; I'll
take my medicine the best I can, but you remember, Jasper,
among a lot of other things we learned when we joined
the scouts, we were warned never under any circumstances
to get under a tree during a thunderstorm."</p>

<p>"But that meant out in the open, where there might
be only one tree," remonstrated Jasper, whose last name
happened to be Merriweather. "Here in the woods it's
a heap different, I should think. Among so many big
trees you don't think now for a minute that freak lightning's
going to pick out the very one we're in, to knock it
to flinders, do you, Larry?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and what's more I ain't going to try
to find out," went on the stockier built lad, with resolution
in his manner. "You and me came away up here
just to see how much we had learned about woodcraft,
and it wouldn't look right if we shied at one of the rules
the first chance. Besides," he went on, with a broad grin,
for Larry was a good-natured fellow ordinarily, "if the
experiment proved to be a dead failure, we wouldn't be
given a chance to try it over again, you see. Lightning
don't often knock at the same door twice."</p>

<p>"Ugh! you make me shiver, Larry!" exclaimed the
smaller lad. "But what in the wide world can we just do
to keep dry?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that's the least thing that bothers me," replied
the other. "Being wet ain't anything much-a-much. I've
tumbled in mill races, and been yanked out of ponds ever
since I was knee high to a duck. But the worst is yet to
come, Jasper."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now you're just trying to scare me, Larry, and you
ought to be ashamed to do it. You know I used to be
the most timid fellow ever, and that it was only after
I joined the scouts, and went on that trip up the Sweetwater
to Lake Solitude that I began to outgrow that failing.
Now it's beginning to get a grip on me again. But
tell me, whatever do you mean by saying the worst is
something more than getting our new uniforms soaked
through?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Jasper, we're lost, that's what!" remarked
Larry, although the fact did not seem to frighten
him very much, for he was chuckling while speaking as
though it looked like a big joke to him.</p>

<p>But with poor Jasper the case was entirely different.</p>

<p>"Well, that beats the Dutch!" he cried with genuine
disgust. "The two of us felt so dead sure we knew it all,
that nothing would do for us but to come away up here
five miles or so from home, just to show everybody that
we could take care of ourselves. And now you deliberately
tell me we've gone and got lost, like the poor little babes
in the woods, and with a terrible storm going to pounce
down on us right away."</p>

<p>"Oh! brace up, Jasper!" exclaimed Larry, seeing the
lower lip of his comrade quivering, and his face showing
signs of becoming pallid. "This may be the making of
us as scouts, you see. No fellow's worth beans until he's
proved that he can take the rough jolts as well as the
smooth things of life. Just put your teeth together, and
say you're going to grin and bear it, no matter what
comes."</p>

<p>"Ain't I trying to, Larry," pleaded the smaller chap,
"but it seems like my teeth keep on rattling all the while.
I'm shivering, and yet it can't be with the cold. I wish I
had some of Elmer Chenowith's nerve just now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shucks! I reckon now that you can have your share
of nerve, Jasper," declared Larry, impatiently, "if only
you make up your mind to <i>take</i> it. Didn't Mr. Garrabrant,
our fine scout-master, tell us only the other night that was
so? Just shut your teeth hard, and say over and over
again that you ain't goin' to let anything feaze you. You'll
be surprised at the feeling it gives you."</p>

<p>"I wonder now, did Elmer really mean to keep tabs on
what we were doing?" remarked Jasper, after another
tremendous peal of thunder had seemed to almost split the
heavens open. "You know, we thought he looked at us
kind of funny when he asked us what we meant to do this
morning, hiking out of Hickory Ridge, with our sticks in
our hands and some grub in our haversacks."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't think Elmer would bother following all
this way," replied Larry, though at the same time he might
have been seen to cast an anxious, eager glance around, as
though indulging in a faint hope himself that something
of the sort had happened.</p>

<p>"Well, he's the best fellow ever, you know, Larry," the
smaller boy went on, "and he's sure taken a heap of interest
in my trying to make a man of myself. He even
took the trouble to come and see me twice, and go over a
lot of things with me that he said a true scout ought to
know."</p>

<p>"Sure Elmer is worth his weight in gold," Larry
affirmed. "And now's the time to show him his faith in
you wasn't wasted, Jasper. Buck up, and just make up
your mind neither of us happens to be made of salt, so a
little juice ain't going to hurt us. As for that lightning,
well, perhaps we might find some hole to climb in, because
it wouldn't hunt us out underground."</p>

<p>"Oh! if we only could!" gasped Jasper, as another flash
came that fairly dazzled both boys; to be succeeded by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sudden report that sounded as though something had exploded
near by.</p>

<p>"Listen! what's that?" demanded the smaller boy,
again clutching his comrade by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Reckon she's hiking along right fast now," answered
Larry, grimly. "Come, let's walk over this way. Who
knows but we might run on some sort of shelter. And
when we're up against such a snag, I tell you flat that
beggars ain't goin' to be choosers if the chance comes our
way."</p>

<p>"That must be rain we hear away off there," suggested
Jasper, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Rain and wind together; and sounds to me like it might
turn out to be something of a howler. Hope the trees don't
go dropping around us. We might have some trouble
dodging 'em if they came too fast."</p>

<p>Jasper shot a quick look at his companion's face, as
if to see whether Larry could mean what he said. Then
he bit his lower lip until it actually bled. But for the
time being not another expression of dismay did he utter.
Fear of ridicule had conquered over the genuine article.</p>

<p>They hurried forward, both of them eagerly looking for
some hollow log, or overturned tree, that might give some
promise of shelter against the deluge that would soon be
upon them.</p>

<p>"You keep tabs on the right, and I'll cover the left!"
remarked Larry, but he had to raise his voice to almost a
shout now, because of the increasing roaring sound that was
sweeping down upon their rear.</p>

<p>"It's getting night in the woods!" cried Jasper, as the
gloom increased.</p>

<p>"Rats!" scoffed his comrade, derisively. "You know
it ain't more'n two o'clock. After it's all over the bully
old sun will be shining again, all right."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! do you really think so, Larry?" asked the other,
grasping at the slightest gleam of hope, just as a drowning
person might at a floating straw.</p>

<p>"Well, it'll be shining, all right," asserted Larry, positively,
"and I reckon we'll be on deck to see it, too. Hi!
what's this here, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Have you struck a place for us to crawl in, Larry?
Oh! I hope so, I'm sure! Why, it's a hollow log, and with
a hole plenty big enough to let a fellow creep inside!"</p>

<p>"That's right," called the other, cheerfully. "And
now suppose you get down on your knees, and push in, feet
first. Then if you should get stuck, you could crawl out
again, see?"</p>

<p>"But looky here, Larry," cried Jasper suddenly and
suspiciously. "It's such an awfully short log, I don't
believe both of us can ever get in it."</p>

<p>"No more we can, Jasper, and all the more reason for
you to crawl in right away now," and Larry began to urge
his comrade to flatten himself out on the ground, with
both feet in touch with the hollow log.</p>

<p>"But how about you, Larry?" expostulated Jasper.</p>

<p>"Shucks! didn't I tell you I wasn't made of sugar or
salt? Rain won't ever hurt Larry Billings. Get a move
on you now, and squeeze in. That wet old rain is mighty
near here now. I thought I felt a drop right then. Crawl,
you slow tortoise! Here, let me give you a shove along."</p>

<p>Jasper turned a white face upward.</p>

<p>"You ain't going to run away, and leave me here, are
you, Larry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What! me?" shouted the other, indignantly. "What
d'ye take me for, Jasper? A true scout would never act
that way to a chum. Not much. I'm just goin' to snuggle
down alongside the log here, and wait till the storm blows
itself out. Get a good grip on yourself now, and nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ain't goin' to hurt you. Give you my word on it, Jasper,"
and he again started to energetically push the smaller lad
into the gaping hole that had offered such an asylum in
time of need.</p>

<p>"And the lightning won't strike this log, either, will
it?" the boy who was accepting the wooden jacket asked.</p>

<p>"Never in the world. That's what Mr. Garrabrant told
us&mdash;hunt out a hollow log if you can, but never a tree that's
standing upright. Nor a barn either, for that matter.
In you go, Jasper; why, man alive, you're going to be as
snug as a bug in a rug, don't you know."</p>

<p>"But Larry, won't you please knock on the side every
little while," asked the timid one, eagerly. "It'll be so
comforting to me to just know you're still there, even if
I can't see you."</p>

<p>"Course I will, and right hearty, too," jollied Larry,
who realized now that the boy was pretty badly rattled by
the terrific roar of the storm, as well as by the strange
gloom that had fallen on the great woods, and in thus
trying to comfort his weaker companion Larry quite forgot
any natural fear he might have himself otherwise experienced.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm fixed all right now," came in half muffled
tones from inside the log, and then suddenly Jasper gave
a shrill cry. "Oh! there's something biting at my feet!
Larry, pull me out, quick! There's a bear or a wildcat
in here, and it'll chew my feet up! Hurry, hurry! get
me out!"</p>

<p>So there seemed nothing for it but that Larry should
catch hold, and help the panic-stricken one out of the
hollow log again. When this had been done, they just stood
there in the gathering gloom and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Reckon you'll just have to take your ducking the same
as me, then," grumbled Larry, with the resigned air of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a martyr who had done his best for a friend, and could not
be blamed for whatever happened.</p>

<p>"Then I will, Larry," said Jasper, trying to be brave,
though still shuddering. "Let's both run over there, and
see if we can find shelter behind the roots of that fallen
tree! Oh! wait, wait, I surely saw something moving
there! Yes, look Larry, there it is again! Why, it's a
man&mdash;no, a boy! that's what it is!"</p>

<p>"Sure it is," laughed Larry, with the greatest relief
possible in his voice; "and no other than Elmer Chenowith,
our scout leader. He <i>did</i> follow us all the way up
here, and it's a mighty good thing for us that happened.
It's all right now, Jasper. He'll know what to do!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LESSON IN WOODCRAFT.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hello!</span> hello! come this way, quick, both of you!"
shouted the sturdy-looking young fellow who had appeared
so opportunely on the scene, and whose coming seemed to
inspire both Larry and Jasper with renewed confidence.</p>

<p>He beckoned as he gave utterance to these words, and
catching hold of his companion's arm Larry hastened to
obey.</p>

<p>There was indeed need of hurrying. Already the drops
had begun to come pattering down, like shot rattling
through the thick leaves overhead. And that furious combination
of howling wind and descending rain was almost
upon them.</p>

<p>Stumbling along, the two boys reached the spot where
stood Elmer Chenowith, who was the assistant scout-master
to the Hickory Ridge Boy Scout troop.</p>

<p>"Here, get back of this upturned mass of roots!" cried
the other, as he pushed both the scouts ahead of him.</p>

<p>The tree in falling, years back, had lifted a great mass
of earth with its roots. This formed a bulwark at least
seven feet in height. And as luck would have it, the
hole in the ground was just on the other side from the direction
where that wind howled now. This proved that the
previous storm, by which the king of the forest had been
bowled over, must have come from exactly opposite that
quarter from whence the present gale was springing.</p>

<p>Neither Larry nor Jasper thought anything about such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a thing just then, their one anxiety being to gain such
shelter as the barricade promised to afford. But Elmer
was always on the watch for curious facts in connection
with the woodcraft he studied at every opportunity, and
this matter was of considerable importance in his eyes.</p>

<p>So the three lads cowered there, trying to make themselves
as small as possible.</p>

<p>"We're bound to get soaked, all right," called Elmer,
as the rain commenced to come down heavier and heavier;
"but then, that doesn't cut any figure in the case. So
long as we keep from being carried away by the hurricane
wind, or have a tree squash down on top of us, we hadn't
ought to complain."</p>

<p>"That's what," answered Larry; "and I tell you we're
both as glad as can be to run across you up here, Elmer.
This storm came on us just when we had to admit we'd
lost our grip of all the boasted woodcraft we knew, and
were at sea."</p>

<p>"Don't try to talk any more just now, fellows!" called
Elmer. "The old storm's making too much racket. Wait
till the worst goes by."</p>

<p>Jasper was still shaking some. True, this shelter promised
to be comforting, but he found reason to fear, from
words Elmer had let fall, that the worst was yet to come,
and that the storm would increase. Otherwise, why should
the scout leader, who was so well versed in everything pertaining
to outdoors, speak of it as a hurricane wind?</p>

<p>So poor Jasper held on to some projection of the fallen
tree, and drew his breath in little gasps. The uplifted mass
of roots protected them in some measure from the rain,
and altogether from the driving wind, but by degrees little
rivers of water commenced to descend from the trees overhead,
and these soon completed the job of soaking the trio
of scouts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The minutes passed, and nothing very serious happened.
True, once or twice Jasper believed he heard a crash as
some weak tree yielded to the strain, and went over. But
this did not come to pass very near them, so they did not
incur any particular danger.</p>

<p>"Seems to be letting up a bit!" finally remarked Larry,
raising his voice in order to be heard, for the racket was
still tremendous.</p>

<p>"Oh! do you really think so?" cried Jasper, excitedly.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of it," declared Elmer, with a
reassuring nod, for he understood the nervous nature of the
smaller boy, and in times past had made it his particular
business to build up Jasper's courage and determination,
always wabbly.</p>

<p>The crashes of thunder as a rule sounded further away,
though now and then one would break that seemed to outdo
all the rest, as though the storm might be trying to linger
in the vicinity of the upturned tree.</p>

<p>Then the rain slackened.</p>

<p>"Not that it matters much," said Elmer, laughing; "because
we're all like drowned rats right now. But wait till
it stops; then we'll build a jolly big fire, and dry off."</p>

<p>"But how about matches&mdash;Larry forgot to bring any,
and I lost mine?" sighed Jasper, dolefully.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all right," the scout leader went on. "I've
got some safe and sound in my pocket right now."</p>

<p>"But if you're soaked through to the skin, won't the
matches be done for?" asked the smaller lad, who was
beginning to feel better already, now that the storm had
broken, and a rift appeared in the dark clouds overhead.</p>

<p>"I could stay in the water ten minutes, and still have
matches to burn," laughed Elmer, "because, you see, I
make it a point to carry them in a water-proof safe that
has been tested, and found all right. Besides, I know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to make a fire without a solitary match, and have done it
again and again."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, to be sure, I saw you do it once!" cried
Larry.</p>

<p>"You mean by use of a little bow, and a stick that
turns around in a notch of some wood, don't you, Elmer?"
asked Jasper, interested.</p>

<p>"Just that," replied the scout leader. "I might try it
now, to show you fellows how it's done; only it generally
takes a lot of time, you know; and the sooner we have a
warm blaze after this rain stops, the better. So we'll stick
to the matches this round."</p>

<p>He was thinking of Jasper, who had never been very
stout or strong, and whom he could feel trembling whenever
he chanced to touch the boy. Excitement, and the
wetting, might cause trouble, unless he found means for
warming the boy up ere long.</p>

<p>By degrees the wind died away completely, while the
rain hardly amounted to much&mdash;in fact, what water fell
was now the drippings from the trees overhead.</p>

<p>"Come, let's get a move on us," said Elmer, as he started
to climb out of the depression behind the upturned roots
of the fallen oak.</p>

<p>"Wow! I'm standing in water half way to my knees!"
laughed Larry, to whom the affair was something like a
picnic&mdash;now that they had run across one who knew how
to find a way out of the labyrinth, dry their clothes, and
generally create an atmosphere of cheer.</p>

<p>"Wait till I take a look in at this tree," observed Elmer,
hurrying around to where the broken pieces of the trunk
lay.</p>

<p>"Whatever is he doing now?" asked Jasper, as he saw
the scout leader clawing at the heart of the fallen forest
monarch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I rather think he's getting some dry wood out
of that log," replied the other. "I've seen him make a
fire in a rain before, and that was the way he got hold of
some tinder for a start. Yes, there he picks up a lot, and
is coming this way with it. We'll soon have a bully blaze
started, and once she gets going why there's oceans of wood
lying around loose here that will burn."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess there are oceans of it; anyhow there's been
enough water turned loose on it to swamp things. Elmer,
is there anything we can do to help?" asked Jasper,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Sure there is, both of you," replied the other, readily.
"Get busy breaking up some of those dead limbs there.
We'll need a lot soon, and besides, it's going to help warm
you up. Jump around, and slap your arms across your
chest, Jasper, just like you would do on a winter's day,
if cold. Here goes for a start," and as he spoke Elmer
applied a match to the little pile of loose dry tinder he had
heaped up.</p>

<p>A flash, and up sprang the flame, for the boy had made
his preparations carefully so as not to waste a single match.
One of the first tests a tenderfoot scout is put to, is to make
a fire in the woods without paper, and possessing only three
matches. The careless new beginner learns how to husband
his resources, after he has been shown how priceless
even so common a thing as a match may become, under
certain conditions.</p>

<p>When the fire had taken a good hold, other fuel was
added, dry so long as it could be obtained, and then some
of the wet stuff, which readily dried off and burned fiercely.</p>

<p>"If I had only had a camp hatchet along," said Elmer,
as he made Jasper disrobe, so as to get his clothes hanging
near the blaze, "I could have done this affair up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
better style; but I reckon none of us have any reason to
growl at the way things are going, eh, fellows?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say not," laughed Larry, who had followed
the example of the others, and was hanging his
garments on convenient roots of the fallen tree, where the
heat would reach them by degrees. "We're lucky all the
way through, and that's a fact. It was mighty good of
you to track us away up here, Elmer. Whatever made you
do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I happened to have nothing to do, and while
neither of you had the politeness to ask me to go along,
why, I thought I'd like to know just how you made out.
So I kept out of sight, and yet near enough to hear what
you said lots of times. And on the whole you did pretty
well, fellows. You can't expect to learn everything about
woodcraft at once, you know; and the time I was up in the
Canada bush gave me a long start over the rest of the
bunch."</p>

<p>He did not want to confess that he had been a little
worried lest the two ambitious scouts get lost in those great
woods lying northwest of Hickory Ridge; but such was
really the case. And as subsequent events proved, his fears
had after all not been groundless.</p>

<p>While their clothes were steaming and drying the boys
jumped around, and managed between thus exercising
themselves, and keeping fairly near the blaze, to ward off
any chilliness; for after the storm the air had become remarkably
cool.</p>

<p>"There's the blooming old sun peeking out!" declared
Larry, presently.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake don't scare it off," said Jasper,
who was now busily engaged getting inside his clothes.
"Oh! say, look here, somebody's changed with me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Elmer; although he gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Larry a wink as he spoke, as if he knew very well what
ailed the other.</p>

<p>"Why, I've got the wrong trousers, that's what! They
look like they'd been made for my younger brother," complained
Jasper; then seeing Larry smiling he continued:
"Now, what are you grinning at, Larry? Trying to play
a joke on me, are you?"</p>

<p>"Well, since both of us are a heap bigger than you,
whose clothes d'ye think you've got hold of anyway, eh?"
demanded Larry. "Fact is, they've shrunk, that's all.
Had 'em too near the fire, after being wet. They'll stretch
again in time, Jasper. Mine are in the same fix, you see."</p>

<p>Amid considerable merriment then, the three scouts
finished dressing.</p>

<p>"I'll never forget this, never," declared Jasper, after
he had completed this operation in the best way possible.</p>

<p>"And just think what a fix we'd still be in if Elmer
here hadn't taken a notion to look us up!" observed Larry.
"It's a fine thing to have a scout leader, who feels a
personal interest in his men. Because, honest Injun, I
don't yet know in just which way home lies. That's about
west over there, because the sun is heading yonder; but
where's Hickory Ridge?"</p>

<p>"Give it up," said Jasper, shaking his head as though
the problem were too much for him. "I'm like you,
Larry; I know the cardinal points of the compass only
because the sun happens to be shining now. When it was
dark I couldn't have told north from south."</p>

<p>"Well, you must get over that failing," declared Elmer,
positively. "Now, just take a good look at all these
forest trees; you notice that nearly every one has a certain
amount of green moss, as we call it, on one side, and
also that it decorates the same side of every tree!"</p>

<p>"Sure enough it is, Elmer; and if a fellow only knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<i>which</i> side, he could always find out how he stood," cried
Jasper.</p>

<p>"In nine cases out of ten that moss is on the north side
of the tree. If it varies at all, it will be found on the
northwest bark. Remember that, fellows, and you need
never want for a compass when in the woods," suggested
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Well, now," remarked Larry, chuckling, "what a
couple of silly geese we were after all, Jasper, to think of
coming away up here in the woods, and never carry even
a compass."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," replied the one addressed, with a sickly
grin; "but the trouble with us, Larry, was our being so
dead sure we knew all about it. After this I'm going to
buy a neat little trick of a compass, and carry it along
with me. Honest, now, I never knew it was so easy to get
twisted around. Some day I'll turn up missing on my way
to school."</p>

<p>"Here's a compass, all right; I seldom go without one,"
remarked Elmer; "though it's mighty seldom a fellow,
who is wide awake, would ever need such a thing where
the trees grow. Now, out on those tremendous prairies
where hundreds of miles of open country surround you
on every side, and one section looks exactly like another,
it's a different question."</p>

<p>"I've heard it said that a fellow can use his watch, if
he's got one, for a compass; how about that, Elmer?" asked
Larry.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," replied the scout leader, "though I don't
ever remember of being put to that test. Still, I can explain
just how it's done, though we haven't time right now to
take the matter up. I reckon we'd better be heading toward
home."</p>

<p>"That suits me to a dot," declared Jasper, cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>He was feeling quite chipper after the recent terrifying
experience. In a great measure it had done the boy good.
His confidence had been strengthened, and in many ways
Jasper saw how necessary it was in times of emergency to
retain both determination and assurance.</p>

<p>They were soon walking briskly through the woods, with
Elmer promising that in a short time he would surely
take his comrades to the road over which they could make
their way to Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"I've got a little news for both of you," said the scout
leader of the Wolf Patrol, as they journeyed on, chattering
like so many jackdaws.</p>

<p>"I hope it ain't bad news then?" remarked Jasper.</p>

<p>"That remains to be proven," Elmer continued, gravely.
"It may turn out good or bad, as happens to enter the
active mind of one Matt Tubbs."</p>

<p>"Oh! the bully of Fairfield&mdash;the fellow who did more
to break up the baseball games with our rival town than all
other causes bunched together. Now, what under the sun
has Fighting Matt gone and done, Elmer?" demanded
Larry, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the scout leader, calmly, "what do you
expect, but get in line, and organize a new and rival troop
of Boy Scouts!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MORE RUMBLINGS OF COMING TROUBLE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Whew!</span> you don't say!" exclaimed Larry, frowning.</p>

<p>"Takes my breath away, that's what!" gasped Jasper.</p>

<p>"Seems to me that both of you look on the event in the
light of what my chum, Mark Cummings, would term a
<i>catastrophe!</i>" chuckled Elmer.</p>

<p>"Well, I know that Matt pretty well," grumbled Larry.
"To tell the truth, him and me have had more'n a few
battles inside the last five years. And I owe more'n one
black eye to his way of carrying his fists. If Matt Tubbs
has gone and organized a gang of scouts it spells trouble
with a big, big T for our fellows. Huh!"</p>

<p>"See here, why do you call the new troop a 'gang'? Is
that respectful, and the way to treat fellow scouts?"
laughed Elmer.</p>

<p>"You know just as well as I do, Elmer," went on the
indignant Larry, "that with such a bully as Matt Tubbs
at the head of it, no collection of scouts could ever get
a charter from Headquarters. Why, the tough crowd he
trains with couldn't begin to subscribe to the twelve cardinal
laws of the organization."</p>

<p>"Well, it makes me smile," said Jasper, though in reality
he looked disgusted. "Think of Matt Tubbs, the bully who
uses more hard words than any fellow I ever ran across,
promising these things: To be trustworthy, loyal, helpful,
friendly, courteous, kind, obedient to authority, cheerful,
thrifty, brave, clean, and last of all but hardest for Matt,
reverent! Oh! my, the world will come to an end before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Tough Matt can hold up his hand in a scout salute, and
solemnly say that he believes in that list."</p>

<p>"It does seem next to impossible," remarked Elmer;
"and yet sometimes miracles happen even in these days,
fellows. Who knows but what we Hickory Ridge scouts
may be given the chance, and the privilege as well, to open
the eyes of Matt Tubbs?"</p>

<p>"That would sure be a miracle!" scoffed Larry, who believed
that he ought to know the subject of their talk better
than Elmer, since the latter had not been living in the
neighborhood more than a year or so, having come with his
father from Canada, where Mr. Chenowith had had charge
of a great ranch and farm.</p>

<p>"All right, we'll wait and see," Elmer went on, evenly.
"Anyhow, I've had the news straight that they have two
patrols enlisted, of eight fellows each. That is doing better
than the Hickory Ridge scouts; because up to now our
patrols are not completed, there being but six in each."</p>

<p>"Say, that's always been a puzzle to me, why Jack
Armitage and Nat Scott were left out to start a new patrol
to be called the Eagle," remarked Jasper.</p>

<p>"I thought you knew about it," replied Elmer. "But
you must have been absent at the time it was talked over.
You see, it's hardest to find fellows qualified to be scout
leaders, and assistant leaders. Plenty of raw recruits can
be enlisted on the other hand. Myself and Mark happened
to be selected for the first patrol, and Matty Eggleston,
with Red Huggins, came along and qualified for the second.
That gave us just six members for each patrol, you see."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm following you, Elmer; please go on," said
Jasper, eagerly.</p>

<p>"It just happened that the next two boys to enlist were
Jack and Nat, both of whom knew considerable about woodcraft,
and were ambitious to learn more. When Mr. Garrabrant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and myself talked it over&mdash;for I was a duly appointed
assistant scout-master by that time, you know&mdash;we
concluded that it would be wise to start a third patrol,
with those two fellows at the head, and after that fill up
our three patrols to the limit of eight each."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Elmer; I get on to it now," Jasper remarked.</p>

<p>"And I understand that several good fellows have applied
for membership in our troop?" observed Larry.</p>

<p>"Yes, their names will be proposed at the next meeting,
which by the way comes this very night. Hope neither
of you will be so leg tired that you stay away. Before
Fall comes around the church improvements will be finished,
and then we'll have a meeting room worth while.
Just now that old wheelwright's shop at the crossroads
must serve our purpose."</p>

<p>"Oh! there, that's too bad!" suddenly ejaculated Jasper,
coming to a halt.</p>

<p>"What ails him now?" Larry remarked, surveying his
companion queerly.</p>

<p>"I went and forgot something; how silly of me," Jasper
went on.</p>

<p>"Oh! we'll agree with you, all right," grinned Larry;
"but suppose you tell us what it was? If you left anything
back there where we hung our clothes on a hickory
limb, until it looked like a regular Irish washday, why,
the chances are you're out that much, because I for one
decline to cover all that ground again."</p>

<p>"And I wanted to know so much!" grumbled Jasper,
as he raised one of his feet and rubbed his shoe regretfully.</p>

<p>Elmer watched his actions and smiled. Evidently he
had guessed what was on the other's mind.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might tell you what it was, Jasper," he said,
quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would, Elmer," cried the other. "Did you
peek in, and see him? And was it a great big black bear,
or a savage bobcat?"</p>

<p>"Neither, I think," came the answer. "You would be
pretty safe to call it a 'coon, and let it go at that."</p>

<p>"What, only a pesky little raccoon, and to pitch in for
me like that?" cried the other. "Why, I thought he was
going to chew me all to pieces, and I was sure it must be
a wildcat at least."</p>

<p>"That may have been because you were excited," the
scout leader pursued; "and I've no doubt but what the
rascal clawed at you, and used his sharp teeth pretty
freely, because he was badly frightened and concerned.
Even a rat will fight when at bay. And he thought you
were coming in to get him."</p>

<p>"But how do you know it was a raccoon?" demanded
Jasper.</p>

<p>"I saw his tracks near the log, in a spot where the rain
hadn't washed them out," Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Jasper laughed, "I forgot that you showed us
how different the tracks of wildcats, raccoons, mink, possums,
and muskrats were. I saw it at the time, but just
now they're all alike 'coons to me. But Elmer, I'm going
to study up on that subject. It seems to grip me more'n
anything else about the scout business, except p'raps that
Injun picture writing. I liked that; and me to be an artist.
I can draw, if I can't excel in other things."</p>

<p>"But when you get to drawing remember that every
picture has got to tell a story, so plain and simple that a
child can read it. That's the beauty of Indian picture
writing. But look, fellows, what's ahead!"</p>

<p>Elmer pointed as he spoke, and the other scouts gave a
hearty cheer.</p>

<p>"The road!" cried Larry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now things look promising," Jasper observed; "and
the walking will be easier. But speaking of shoes, I suppose
those scratches on mine will prove my little yarn about
the hollow log, when I tell it to the bunch. If they try
to make out I'm stretching things, you fellows have just
got to back me up."</p>

<p>"So long as you stick to facts we will," remarked Larry;
"but take care you don't go to calling it a bobcat, or a
tiger. I'll throw up my hands at that."</p>

<p>"A scout is truthful, even if it doesn't say anything
about that in the twelve articles we subscribe to," remarked
Jasper, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Elmer broke in, "and now that Jasper knows it
was only a 'coon that had its den in that hollow log, he
will never try to say it was a wildcat; though if he wants
he can declare he <i>thought</i> at the time he was being attacked
by a panther."</p>

<p>"I somehow can't help thinking of that Matt Tubbs,"
Larry observed, after they had been tramping along the
road for half an hour or more, and had covered nearly two
miles of the five separating them from Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"Yes," Elmer admitted, "I suppose there'll be more
or less talk about him to-night at the meeting. Now, if
his crowd only went into this thing the right way, what
great times we could have competing with the Fairfield
troop! But as it is, as they find themselves debarred from
becoming affiliated with the regular Boy Scout organization,
I'm afraid Matt and his cronies will try to take it out on
us, by giving us all the trouble they can."</p>

<p>"Why, I wouldn't put anything past that mean chap,"
declared Jasper.</p>

<p>"It does seem as though Matt didn't have any redeeming
qualities about him," remarked Elmer, thoughtfully; "and
yet, fellows, do you remember that just one year ago when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a house burned over at Fairfield, who was it dashed recklessly
into the building, when even the regular fire laddies
held back, and pulled an old woman out alive? Seems to
me that was Matt Tubbs, queer though it sounds."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Elmer," admitted Larry. "We all
wondered about it at the time, and were beginning to think
Matt might be turning over a new leaf, but the next time
we met him he was just the same nasty scrapper as ever."</p>

<p>"And you know," went on Jasper, "it turned out that
the old woman was his grandmother, and not a stranger."</p>

<p>"All the better," said Elmer, stoutly. "It proves that
Matt must have had some human feeling in that tough heart
of his, to risk his life for an old and infirm woman. But
listen, fellows, I thought I heard somebody shouting!"</p>

<p>The three scouts stood still, and strained their ears.</p>

<p>"Oh! help! help! won't somebody come to help us?"
came a wailing cry, in what seemed to be a woman's voice.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" exclaimed Jasper, "somebody's
in a peck of trouble right around that bend in the road
there!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I remember there was a house along here
somewhere," Larry cried, as the three of them started on a
sprint along the road.</p>

<p>When presently they turned the bend they came upon a
scene that gave them a severe shock. And even Jasper forgot
all his recent thrilling experiences in the warm impulse
of his boyish heart to prove of some assistance to those
who seemed in such dire need of aid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FIRST AID TO THE INJURED.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Apparently</span> the storm that had so lately passed over
this section had played particular havoc with the farm
buildings. Perhaps, with the queer, jumping movements
known to cyclones, it had dipped down in this one quarter
much more severely than anywhere else near by.</p>

<p>At any rate, it had succeeded in partly demolishing a
barn, scattered several tons of fine hay&mdash;that year's crop&mdash;and
upset things generally.</p>

<p>The first thing the scouts noticed after that one glance
around at the damage done by the gale, was that a little
group of persons seemed to be hovering over a certain spot.</p>

<p>"Somebody hurt by the storm!" Elmer called over his
shoulder, for, being a good runner, he had easily taken
the lead&mdash;Jasper was not so very strong, while Larry happened
to be built much too stockily for a sprinter.</p>

<p>Then the boys received another shock. One of those
bending over had straightened up, and proved to be a stout-looking
boy, with a bold, resolute face.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jasper may have been reminded of the old
saying he had heard quoted in his home many times:
"Speak of an angel, and you'll feel his wings;" only no
one who knew Matt Tubbs would ever dream of comparing
that quarrelsome youth with a celestial visitor; in fact,
their thoughts would be more apt to go out in the other
direction.</p>

<p>Two women were wringing their hands, and crying. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
man lay upon the ground, and his groans told that he was
suffering considerable bodily pain.</p>

<p>"Don't I wish Ted Burgoyne was along!" exclaimed
Elmer involuntarily, as he hurried toward the group.</p>

<p>The boy mentioned belonged to the Wolf Patrol. He
seemed to possess a natural fancy for surgery, and had
long ago been dubbed Dr. Ted by his mates. And in numerous
instances had he proved that their confidence in
him was not misplaced.</p>

<p>That was why Elmer now felt keen regret because of
a lost opportunity for the young Boy Scout medicine man
to show his skill at setting broken bones, or binding up
other injuries almost as well as any experienced physician
could have done.</p>

<p>Elmer himself had made it a point to know something
about such things. He had in the past lived a wild life
out in the great Canada wilderness, where men, and boys,
too, find it necessary to depend upon themselves in great
emergencies.</p>

<p>Although he feared he might be somewhat clumsy, and
certainly lacked the natural talent Ted Burgoyne had
always shown, the scout leader was only too willing to do
whatever lay in his power to alleviate suffering.</p>

<p>In another moment he was leaning over the stricken
man, whom he now recognized as a middle-aged farmer,
Simon Kent by name. The women, wife and daughter
of the farmer, had looked up eagerly as Matt seemed to
speak of the coming of others on the scene. Then their
faces grew blank again with despair. For what could a
trio of mere boys do, when a doctor was needed so badly?</p>

<p>"Oh! Matt, find the horse if you can, and hurry to
town for Dr. Cooper! He couldn't have run very far
away!" the older woman was saying, doubtless referring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to the horse, and not the well-known Hickory Ridge physician.</p>

<p>"Please wait just a minute or so, and let me take a look
at Mr. Kent," said Elmer, modestly. "I happen to know
a little about these things, you see, ma'am; and I've set
more than one broken limb."</p>

<p>The women stopped wailing for a time, and watched the
confident boy as he carefully examined the groaning
farmer.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Larry of Matt Tubbs,
who apparently must be some relative of the Kents, as
the woman seemed to know him very well.</p>

<p>"Storm blew the roof off'n the barn, and he got caught.
Any feller with peepers in his head ought tuh see that,"
replied young Tubbs, between whom and Larry there had
always been bad blood.</p>

<p>Elmer looked up and smiled in the faces of the two
frightened women. He knew they needed encouragement,
and that he could not do them a greater benefit than to
allay their fears.</p>

<p>"He has a broken arm," he said, reassuringly, "and I
think a couple of his ribs are fractured, Mrs. Kent; but
besides that there are only a few bruises, and they do not
amount to much. Nothing very serious, understand. Mr.
Kent isn't going to die. But I guess he'd better have the
doctor here as soon as Matt can ride to town. I'll do what
I can in the meantime, ma'am."</p>

<p>Matt Tubbs had been watching what he did with apparently
the greatest curiosity. He was utterly ignorant himself
about everything that pertained to first aid to the
injured, and perhaps never before had felt so utterly insignificant
as when he saw Elmer Chenowith go about the
duties of a doctor with such calm assurance.</p>

<p>Jasper had run off in obedience to a request from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
scout leader, and now returned with some cold water.
When Elmer had dashed a little of this in the face of the
farmer, the injured man came to his senses. His groans
ceased, though they could see from the expression on his
rugged face that he was suffering severely.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mr. Kent," Elmer hastened to say in
that convincing way of his, as the farmer looked at him
inquiringly. "You've got a broken arm, and perhaps a
couple of your ribs are out of the running for a while,
but you'll pull through all to the good. I'm going to do
what I can while Matt rides off for Dr. Cooper."</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you, Elmer, is it?" said the man, faintly.
"But how d'ye know I ain't got my death in that wreck
of my barn? I feel like I'd been through a threshing
machine; on'y my left arm is numb."</p>

<p>"I've had some experience with these things, Mr. Kent,
up in Canada. Besides, sir, we belong to the Boy Scouts
movement, and one of the things taught there is what we
call 'first aid to the injured.' I could set your arm all
right, but since the doctor can get here soon, I'd better
leave it for him. He mightn't like my meddling too much
with his practice. Will you ask Matt to please find the
horse, and start for town?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm agoin', all right," said that worthy, arousing
himself; for he had been staring at Elmer all this while,
and listening to what he said about the obligations of the
scouts in time of need, as though he might be hearing
something that astonished him.</p>

<p>He glanced back several times as he walked away to look
for the horse, that was doubtless in some corner of the lot
beyond the demolished barns.</p>

<p>"Got something to think over, I reckon," grunted Larry,
who had closed up like a clam when Matt answered his
civil question so roughly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly afterward they heard a shout. Then Matt
dashed past, riding bareback on the horse, and using the
halter to guide him along the road. He went flying toward
town, and they knew he would send the doctor before a
great while.</p>

<p>"Here, fellows, Mr. Kent ought to be carried into the
house," said Elmer, turning to his chums. "We've got
to make a litter to lay him on. Come over here with me,
and we'll knock one together in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Sure we will!" declared Larry, who had a warm heart,
even though a bit inclined to quarrel at times, being quick-tempered.</p>

<p>There was plenty of material lying around; the storm
had seen to that when it tore things loose on the Kent
farm. And presently the scouts came back with some
boards forming a very fair litter. Elmer had covered it
with several horse blankets he discovered in the partly
demolished barn.</p>

<p>But the farmer was getting back his strength again. He
shook his head at sight of the litter, and a slight smile
appeared on his face, much to the joy of his sadly frightened
wife and daughter.</p>

<p>"I reckon I ain't so bad off as to need that, Elmer," he
remarked. "Now, if so be ye boys draw around, and take
care not to handle that left arm too rough, p'raps I could
manage to get up. Arter that, with some help, I'll hobble
to the house. Don't ye look so peaked, wife; I'm better'n
ten dead men yet."</p>

<p>They helped him to rise, and then, leaning on Elmer,
with the others following close behind, eager to assist, they
made their way slowly to the farm building.</p>

<p>"Oh! what would we have done only for the coming of
you boys?" exclaimed Mrs. Kent, after they had managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to get the wounded farmer seated fairly comfortably in a
big sleepy hollow chair.</p>

<p>Elmer was making a sling in which the broken arm could
be held, to ease the pain and the strain until Dr. Cooper's
arrival.</p>

<p>"Does this scouting teach you boys how to do that sort
of thing?" asked the grown daughter, who had been watching
these actions of the boys curiously.</p>

<p>"It is one of the things we have to learn before we can
hope to become first-class scouts," the boy replied. "You
see, no one can ever tell when a scout may be called on
to help bring back a person to life who has been nearly
drowned, or to keep another from bleeding to death after
being cut with an ax in camp; then besides, sometimes boys
have to be rescued when they get a cramp while in swimming.
And when a fellow knows how to go about these
things, he may be able to help save a human life. We think
it worth while."</p>

<p>"I should say it was!" exclaimed Miss Kent, enthusiastically.
"After this I'm going to take more interest in
boys than I have. I always thought they were as much alike
as peas in a pod; and perhaps I oughtn't to say it, because
he's in our family, but you see, I somehow judged all boys
by my Cousin Matt."</p>

<p>Elmer smiled.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, nodding, "I hope that when you come
to look into this a little closer, Miss Julia, you'll understand
that it stands for big things. My father says it's
the greatest movement for the uplifting of American boys
that ever happened, barring none. And I'm going to send
you some printed matter that will tell you just what the
Boy Scouts aim to do. When you know that, I just guess
you'll find reason to change your opinion of boys."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the injured farmer had listened to what was said
with a show of interest.</p>

<p>"Sho! Elmer," he remarked, "I've heard a heap of
this thing, and didn't take much stock in it. Thought it
meant the boys was goin' to be made into soldiers, and as
I'm a man of peace I couldn't stand for that. On'y yesterday
the dominie was tellin' me it ain't got a blessed
thing to do with military tactics. And arter the able way
you handled yourself to-day, blessed if I ain't agoin' to
read the stuff you send Julie. If I had a boy I'd like him
to jine the scouts. And that's as far as I've got. But if
it makes the lads clean, manly, and ekal to emergencies,
like you seem to be, it's a boss thing."</p>

<p>And Elmer felt his heart glow with satisfaction, for his
whole interest was by now bound up in the success of the
Hickory Ridge troop of scouts; and anything that went
to make them new friends appealed to him strongly.</p>

<p>When half an hour had gone the sound of an automobile
horn was heard out on the road.</p>

<p>"There comes Dr. Cooper!" called Jasper, who had been
on the lookout.</p>

<p>When the physician came bustling in he looked questioningly
at the three boys. Possibly Matt may have told
him the scouts were meddling with things, and his professional
instincts were shocked. But when he saw what
Elmer had done, and made an examination himself, he declared
that the extent of Mr. Kent's injuries were just as
the boy had stated.</p>

<p>"And I want to say, Elmer," he added, as the boys
were about to hurry away, "I believe in the first-aid-to-the-injured
principle which you boys try to live up to. If more
people only kept their senses about them in cases of accident,
it would make easier work for the doctors, and save
lots of lives. Good luck to you, boys!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we shall never be able to tell you how thankful
we all are for your coming, Elmer. The first time I meet
your mother, I'm going to let her know what a fine son
she has," declared Miss Julia, as she and her relieved
mother shook hands with the three scouts at the door.</p>

<p>"I had two comrades, please remember, Miss Julia,"
said Elmer, significantly; and taking the hint she repeated
the words while bidding Jasper and Larry good-by.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Elmer, as he and his chums once more
tramped along the road, "I notice that you two fellows
have your badges turned upside down still, to remind you
that so far to-day you've found no opportunity to do anybody
a good turn. As your scout master, I want to say that
you can't get them changed any too soon; for you've just
been of the greatest help to the Kent family!"</p>

<p>And both Larry and Jasper, making the usual scout
salute, with the thumb holding back the little finger of the
right hand, proceeded to unfasten their badges, and replace
them right side up.</p>

<p>They had earned the privilege to wear them so for the
balance of that eventful day!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MEETING IN THE OLD WAGON SHOP.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">About</span> time to begin business, don't you think,
Mark?" asked Elmer Chenowith.</p>

<p>"Just about on the minute; and I've been counting noses,
Mr. Scout-master; there are eighteen fellows present&mdash;not
a single gap in the line," answered his chum.</p>

<p>"That's fine. We'll get our four new members through
to-night, and have two complete patrols, with a third well
started. Suppose you sound the assembly, Mark, and we'll
close the doors. While the Hickory Ridge Troop of Boy
Scouts doesn't pretend to be a secret society, there's no
reason why we should have every Tom, Dick, and Harry
gaping in at us, and listening to all we say."</p>

<p>Elmer and his closest chum, Mark Cummings, were
standing inside the old abandoned wagon-maker's shop that
for long years had been a landmark at the crossroads just
outside the town of Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>Half a dozen and more lighted lanterns hanging from
beams or the low rafters dissipated the darkness of the cobwebby
interior; for the once busy shop had been deserted
some years now.</p>

<p>A bustling, laughing, chattering crowd of half-grown
boys occupied the place; and all but four of them were clad
in the customary olive drab khaki uniform of the scouts,
met with in every part of this wide country, between the
Pacific and the Atlantic, and from the Great Lakes of the
north to the Mexican Gulf on the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark carried a bugle at his side, and was quite a genius
as a musician. Indeed, there were few musical instruments
he could not play; and when in camp the boys looked to
him to enliven the evenings around their fire with bugle,
banjo, or mandolin.</p>

<p>Another member of the troop was the official drummer;
but as yet he had not secured an instrument on which to
sound the long roll. But they lived in hopes of soon supplying
this need, as there was good money in the treasury.</p>

<p>When the sweet, clear notes of the bugle sounded the
assembly call, the chattering ceased. Obedience is one of
the first principles inculcated in the breast of a scout; and
Elmer, as the president of the association, had always insisted
upon the meeting being conducted with a fair
amount of decorum.</p>

<p>First came the roll call, when it was found that every
member was present, showing that the meeting was deemed
an especially important one.</p>

<p>True, several of the boys looked a bit tired, notably Jasper,
who had hardly been able to get out of his chair after
supper, and was obliged to exert more than the ordinary
amount of will power before he could reach the place of
meeting.</p>

<p>A little routine program was first of all gone through
with, such as marked each meeting of the troop&mdash;a song
that was patriotic in its character sung, with considerable
vim, for there were some really good voices present; after
which the commendable trait of patriotism was further carried
along by a salute to the flag which stood at one end
of the dingy old wheelwright's shop, where all eyes could
fall upon its starry blue field and warm red stripes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to state," said Elmer, in opening the meeting,
"that our capable scout-master was unable to be with
us to-night, as a sudden business call took him to New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
last night. So we'll have to conduct the exercises without
him. And as the most important part of our meeting is the
initiation of four new members who have lately expressed a
desire to unite with the Hickory Ridge Troop of Boy Scouts,
it would be in order for a motion that we proceed immediately
to complete that function."</p>

<p>"I move, Mr. President, we go about that business,"
suggested "Lil Artha" Stansbury, who had curled his
long legs under him, and managed to sit down on a low
stool he had found somewhere; the balance of the boys
being disposed of in all sorts of ways, some on worn
wooden "horses," others on blocks of wood, makeshift
benches, and even on the bare ground.</p>

<p>"Thecond the motion!" cried Ted Burgoyne, who often
lisped, though he could never be convinced of the fact, and
would everlastingly and vehemently deny it when accused.</p>

<p>Of course it was quickly carried; and the usual ceremonies
having been gone through with, the four applicants
were declared fairly elected members of the organization.
Phil Dale became Number Five and George Robbins
Number Six of the Wolf Patrol; while Henry Condit and
"Landy" Smith filled the vacant numbers of the Beaver
Patrol.</p>

<p>"This makes our two patrols complete," remarked
Elmer. "It also increases our membership to eighteen.
We need several more fellows of the right sort, and if
any of you happen to know of any candidates, bring their
names before the committee between now and the next
regular meeting. But they must be boys of good moral
character, who promise to make scouts worthy of the
name."</p>

<p>"Hear! hear!" called out "Red" Huggins, grinning,
as though he took this as a personal compliment.</p>

<p>"We can now proceed with the regular business before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
us. The new members will consult with Comrade Merriweather
about their suits. But of course they understand
that every cent must have been earned before they can
wear the new clothes. That is one of the things we stand
for&mdash;a scout must be independent, and able to do things
for himself. It tends to make him manly and reliant."</p>

<p>"Mr. President," said the secretary, who was no other
than the tall "Lil Artha," "I would like to inform the
members of Hickory Ridge Troop that I have with me a collection
of finished pictures, taken on our recent camping
trip at Lake Solitude. Some of them are rather interesting,
and will serve to revive pleasant, or unpleasant, memories.
They can be seen after the meeting closes. Please excuse
me for not rising, Mr. President. Fact is, I don't believe
I could without help, for it seems as if my lower extremities
had become locked."</p>

<p>There were numerous snickers at this, for it was a failing
of the good-natured "Lil Artha" to get his long legs
twisted in a knot; though, when he once started running,
he could cover the ground at an amazing pace.</p>

<p>"I understand," remarked Matty Eggleston, the leader
of the Beaver Patrol, getting up so suddenly from the
swaying bench upon which he had been seated that it tilted
the remaining three scouts backward, and deposited them
on the ground, to the amusement of the assemblage&mdash;"I
understand," he went on, not disturbed by the tragic occurrence,
as the boys scrambled up, and began to brush
themselves off, "that several of our number met with an
interesting experience to-day while off on a hike. The
rest of us would like very much to hear an account of what
happened."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! tell us the story, Mr. President! We all
want to know!" came from a dozen of the lads, in one
breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p>"If some one puts that in the form of a motion, and
it is carried, perhaps between Comrades Larry, Jasper,
and myself we might be able to spin the little yarn," he
remarked.</p>

<p>Needless to say the motion was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," said Larry, who was Number Six of
the Beavers, "I suggest that you give your version of the
little adventure. If necessary, Jasper and myself can dip
in, and add some touches to it from time to time."</p>

<p>Nothing loath, for he had an object in letting the new
recruits see what splendid chances there were for <i>doing
things</i> in the scout organization, both for themselves and
others, the acting scout-master started to tell how Larry
and Jasper had conceived a laudable ambition to test their
knowledge of woodcraft, and started out with the idea of
putting it to the trial.</p>

<p>He pointed out their mistakes, and showed where they
could have avoided them. He commended their pluck, and
as he described the storm in the big timber more than
a few of the listening boys fairly quivered with excitement.
In imagination they could almost hear the terrific
thunder, and see the giant trees swaying in the howling
wind.</p>

<p>After Elmer had brought out a number of points that
would serve as a valuable lesson to the tenderfoot scouts,
and which he wanted to sink into their minds, he presently
carried the story to the final stage by telling about
their arrival at the farmhouse, where they found the family
in great distress, and in need of help.</p>

<p>He made a particular point of telling how helpless Matt
Tubbs had seemed, simply because he had never been instructed
in the principles of "first aid to the injured";
and went on to show how very important it was for every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
true scout to know what to do in an emergency where
human life was in peril.</p>

<p>When, finally, Elmer finished, there was a hearty cheer
from the assembled lads. A number of questions were
asked, which either the acting scout-master or one of his
mates answered.</p>

<p>"But perhaps another time, comrades, Matt Tubbs may
not feel so helpless as he did to-day," Elmer went on to
say. "The fever has reached Fairfield, and we hear they
are trying to organize a troop of scouts there, with Matt
at the head. Let us hope, fellows, that when the Fairfield
Troop becomes a fact, there may be a chance for the Hickory
Ridge boys to renew their old-time rivalry with the
neighboring town. For the rowdy spirit will have to give
way to order and decency before Matt Tubbs and his
cronies ever find themselves accepted as Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>"They never will do it!" cried Ty Collins, who had been
the chief cook of the troop while in camp, and was known
as one of the best athletes in Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"That's what I was saying to Elmer," echoed Larry
Billings.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, you never can tell," laughed the leader. "I
sometimes think none of us know just what Matt Tubbs
might do, if once he took a notion to turn over a new leaf."</p>

<p>"Oh! he's just a regular bully, and that's all there is
about it!" cried Nat Scott.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't say that again, Nat," remarked
Elmer. "I know on the face of things people around Hickory
Ridge think that, because Matt always started trouble
when the two towns used to be rivals on the gridiron and
the diamond. But over in Fairfield, fellows, they're not
quite so sure about it. Perhaps all of you don't know that
when a house burned down, and the firemen were afraid to
rush in to save an old and infirm woman who was known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to be inside, Matt Tubbs took his life in his hands <i>and got
her out!</i> It was his own grandmother, but that makes no
difference. I say that the fellow who would do that can't
be all wrong; that he must have a spark, and a pretty big
one, too, of decency in his make-up. Those are just the
kind of fellows this scout movement can help. And I believe
that if once they <i>change about and face the other way</i>,
they're bound to make the best of scouts. Let's give Matt
Tubbs a fair and square chance to make good!"</p>

<p>Considerable talk followed. Some of the boys were farsighted
enough to grasp what Elmer believed so firmly.
Others shook their heads in doubt. They fancied they knew
Matt Tubbs like a book. He was no coward, they admitted
such a fact, but as for him ever being able to subscribe to
the twelve cardinal principles of a scout, why it was absurd;
impossible!</p>

<p>"Water will run up-hill before that miracle ever happens!"
declared Toby Jones, the boy who was forever
dreaming about doing wonderful stunts with a flying machine
which he expected some day to invent.</p>

<p>"I have no particular use foh the gentleman, suh!"
remarked Chatz Maxfield, whose manners and ways of expressing
himself easily betrayed his Southern birth.</p>

<p>So the meeting progressed, and was finally brought to
a conclusion. Then there was considerable merriment as
the scouts clustered about "Lil Artha," the official photographer,
as he passed around some scores of splendidly
executed prints. Quite a number of these were gems of
art, and represented natural scenery around the mountain
lake where the camp had been located. Others elicited
roars of laughter, for Arthur had snapped off some pictures
that perpetuated scenes of a comical nature.</p>

<p>The boys were enjoying the treat heartily, laughing,
bandying remarks, poking fun at the victims who were now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
held up to public view, and mingling with perfect freedom,
as the meeting had been adjourned, when something certainly
not down on the bills came to pass.</p>

<p>It was as unexpected as a bolt of lightning from a clear
sky. The photographer of the troop was gathering his
pictures together, and those members who had kindly furnished
the lanterns so that their temporary meeting-place
might be illuminated in a seemly manner, were starting to
secure their property, when, without any warning, there
sounded a tremendous crash.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried half a dozen of the scouts, as they
looked at one another in dismay.</p>

<p>"I know!" shouted Jack Armitage, whose father owned
the old smithy; "we've been spied on by some sneak; and
he fell down off that rotten loft yonder. There he goes,
fellows! After the spy!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LITTLE RED BUTTON.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A scene</span> of commotion immediately followed these startling
words of Jack Armitage. There was a rush for the
exit, and in the confusion, just as might have been expected,
the scouts became wedged in the doorway, so that there was
a brief delay in gaining the open air.</p>

<p>Shouts outside presently told that some of the wiser ones
had avoided this combined rush, and sought the open air
by the same means taken by the unknown. They had just
glimpsed some dim figure amid the cloud of dust that followed
the breaking down of the frail floor of the little
platform at the rear of the shop. It had vanished through
some hole; possibly a board or two had been previously
loosened with the idea of a hasty flight in case of discovery,
to avoid unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>Elmer and his chum, Mark Cummings, had not taken
part in either the crush at the door, or the swift passage
through the rear opening.</p>

<p>"Well, what d'ye think of that?" demanded Mark, turning
to his chum, as the last of the jam at the door was
broken, allowing the struggling scouts a chance to get
through.</p>

<p>Elmer was laughing.</p>

<p>"Some of those fellows will feel a little sore after that
football rush," he remarked; "you noticed that the wise
ones chased after 'Lil Artha.' He was quick to see that
there would be a crush at the door, and he went after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fellow, who lit out by the way of the back part of the shop.
Here, let's take a look and see."</p>

<p>Picking up a lantern, he led the way to where they discovered
a hole in the board wall of the place. Two of the
shrunken boards had been lately wrenched loose; a very
easy task indeed, for the old place was pretty near the
point of ruin.</p>

<p>"Looks like he might have fixed it for use in case he
wanted to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vamose'">vamoose</ins> in a big hurry," said Mark, after they
had examined the boards.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he did," Elmer remarked. "Did you get a
look at the chap, Mark? It just happened that some one
stood between me and this part of the shop, and I couldn't
see much more'n a lot of dust."</p>

<p>"Same here," laughed the other. "My! what a lot of
dust he did stir up. I feel like I'm going to sneeze right
now," which he proceeded to do with great vigor, to the
amusement of his friend.</p>

<p>"Listen to the racket the boys are making out there,"
he observed, as shouts came floating in to them.</p>

<p>"Sounds like they were chasing after something," Mark
went on, after listening. "Wonder if they can grab the
fellow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better call them back with your bugle.
No use breaking up in such a disorderly way. And if he's
given them the slip up to now, they won't be able to find
him in the dark. Step outside and sound the recall, Mark."</p>

<p>So the bugler hastened to obey orders, and the clear, penetrating
notes of the signal floated near and far in the night
air.</p>

<p>"Anybody could hear that a mile away, I guess," remarked
the one who had sent forth the recall. "I suppose
every scout will know what it means and come back?"</p>

<p>"Well, that would be queer if they didn't," declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Elmer. "Here comes a bunch right now, talking and arguing
over the mysterious happening. All sorts of ideas will
be given, and we ought to try and find out the truth."</p>

<p>"What do you think?" asked Mark, pointedly. "Was
it a hobo who had been sleeping here in the old shop?
I've heard Jack say his father threatened to burn the shanty
down because complaints came in about it being a lodging
place for tramps."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Elmer, who looked serious, "I've heard
the same thing. But between you and me, Mark, I've got
my suspicions that it couldn't have been just a common
hobo."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" asked his chum.</p>

<p>"Oh! several things. I don't see why a tramp would
go to all the bother to climb up on that old shelf or loft,
when he could just as well stay right here on the ground,
and make a fire in the regular place, so as to cook his supper.
Then no tramp would have lain there all that time
without making a sound. Besides, you remember we made
up our minds that the boards had been loosened in the
back of the shop, so they could be knocked off with a single
kick. That would point to strategy&mdash;making ready for a
sudden get-away."</p>

<p>"Elmer, you're right, I do believe, as you nearly always
are," said Mark, as if what his comrade said had sunk with
conviction into his mind. "But here come the boys. Let's
find out what they think about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the acting scout-master, "perhaps
they've sighted the fellow, and can tell us who he was."</p>

<p>But this proved not to be the case. Those who had followed
"Lil Artha" through the opening in the rear of the
shop declared that the fugitive must have had the wings
of the wind, for though they had chased after him, he managed
to give them the slip. Possibly the long-legged Arthur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
might have been more successful, had he been given daylight
to enable him to see where he was going; but at the time the
bugle sounded the retreat they had not been able to cut
down the other's lead.</p>

<p>Nor could they tell what he looked like.</p>

<p>"Some stray Wandering Willie, sure as you're born,"
declared Toby Jones, who was panting at a great rate after
his chase.</p>

<p>"And if we'd only been able to come up with him,
wouldn't he have got it?" remarked Red Huggins, ferociously.</p>

<p>"Alas! I was cheated out of a thlick job, that's what,
fellowth," lamented Dr. Ted, whose sole ambition it was
to run across "opportunities" to experiment with his
knowledge of medicine, or attempt simple surgical operations.</p>

<p>"See here, you're only guessing when you say it was a
hobo; what proof is there of such a thing?" demanded
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's that?" exclaimed "Lil Artha," staring
at the acting scout-master.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I was saying to Chatz as we were
prancing along back here," Larry Billings remarked, nodding
his head as if he agreed with Elmer.</p>

<p>"Some think it was a tramp, and the rest say it was a
spy. Now, how are we going to prove it?" asked Tom
Cropsey.</p>

<p>"Let Elmer tell what he thinks, fellows," Mark observed.
"He convinced me right off the reel, and perhaps
he can the rest of the bunch."</p>

<p>"Yes, Elmer, it's up to you to make good. Tell us what
you know. We're wanting to learn all the tricks of a scout
who keeps his eyes always open, and sees the little things
that count. Please tell us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>So, beset from every side, Elmer had to bow to the popular
will. After he had explained how several strong points
seemed to dispose of the theory of a tramp having been
hidden in the loft of the deserted wheelwright's shop, he
saw that he had carried pretty much all his audience with
him. The scouts hung on his every word, for they understood
that Elmer had passed through considerable experience
while out on that big Canada ranch and farm with
his father, and knew how to read signs as well as any Indian
ever could have done.</p>

<p>"I've just been up there and discovered how the rotten
timbers gave way under the fellow," spoke up Nat Scott,
who was known to be of a very investigating turn, and
would let nothing continue to puzzle him long, if he could
help it.</p>

<p>"Yes, we saw you drop down through the same hole he
made," laughed Ty Collins.</p>

<p>"You're covered with dust, too, Nat," remarked Tom
Cropsey.</p>

<p>"That's a fact," grinned the investigator.</p>

<p>Elmer had his eye on him. He judged that Nat must
have made some sort of discovery, for he looked pleased.
He also noted the fact that the other kept one hand behind
him as he stood there.</p>

<p>"You found something, didn't you, Nat?" he asked,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, sure thing," remarked the other; though he
looked somewhat surprised at Elmer being able to discover
this fact so readily.</p>

<p>"Which you're hiding behind you right now, I opine,"
continued the scout-master.</p>

<p>"That's what he is, Elmer!" declared several of the
other scouts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you find it on the ground among those broken
pieces of flooring?" asked Elmer, pointedly.</p>

<p>Nat nodded his head rigorously, but he made no effort to
bring his right hand out from behind his back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps now," continued the other slowly, but with a
positive ring to his voice, "it might happen to be a hat or
a cap you picked up?"</p>

<p>"That's right, it's a cap," broke in Jasper Merriweather,
who had slipped behind Nat, and glimpsed at what he
was trying to keep hidden.</p>

<p>"Wait, I'm going to turn my back on you, Nat, while
you hold it up so all the rest can see. Now, out with it.
Take a good look, fellows. Jasper said it was a cap. Does
it belong to anybody here?"</p>

<p>"Why, we've all got our regular scout hats, except the
four new members, and every one of them has a cap on his
head right now!" declared Jack Armitage.</p>

<p>"Just so," Elmer continued. "That settles one thing;
this cap you picked up must belong to the fellow who ran
away, after listening to all we did at our meeting! Take
a good look at that cap, Nat. Is it a sort of mixed gray in
color and pretty well worn?"</p>

<p>"Say, that's what it just is now, Elmer," replied the
other in surprise.</p>

<p>"And has it got a red button fastened in front just over
the peak?"</p>

<p>"Hey, listen to him tell, will you, fellows. Here's the
red button all right."</p>

<p>"Then the mystery is solved," laughed Elmer; "for
that cap belongs to a certain boy we happen to know right
well; and his name is Matt Tubbs!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A JOB FOR THE BOY SCOUTS TO DO.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> makes you so sure about that, Elmer?" asked
Ty Collins, after the scouts had expressed their wonder
that the leader should be able to speak so positively when
as yet he had not even looked at the tell-tale cap.</p>

<p>"Listen, fellows," began Elmer; "all of you older scouts
know that one of the things impressed upon a new beginner
is the power of observation. Members of the organization
are given tests at memorizing things they see in a store
window, after looking in for just three minutes, and then
writing out a list afterward. In that way they find it
second nature to note everything they see, so that if asked
about it afterward they are able to give a pretty good
description even of little details. I'm saying this more for
the benefit of the new members than anything else, you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Sure we do, Elmer; go right along, please," remarked
Ty.</p>

<p>"All right," continued the leader, impressively; "but
it seems that every one of the scouts doesn't happen to apply
those principles of observation and memory as much
as he might. Now, to make my point plain, there were two
of you with me to-day when we came on the Kent house,
where we found things upset by the storm. And I suppose
both of those scouts had just as many chances to look Matt
Tubbs over as I did; yet it seems that neither Larry nor
Jasper noticed that he wore a pair of worn tan shoes, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
on brown trousers that had been patched in the seat; sported
a new flannel shirt made of some rather flashy material
that carried a good deal of red in it; wore a sporty tie of
the same color; and had a gray cap on his head, with a little
red button just over the peak!"</p>

<p>Exclamations of surprise broke out all around the speaker.</p>

<p>"Say, do you mean to tell us you noticed all those details,
and right while we were all excited over the injuries of the
farmer?" gasped Larry.</p>

<p>"I always said there was only one Elmer Chenowith,"
murmured Jasper, throwing up both hands, as though convinced.</p>

<p>"Why, there was nothing queer about that," laughed
the acting scout-master. "As I told you just now, it grows
to be second nature, after you've practiced the thing for a
while. But did I prove my point, fellows?"</p>

<p>"You certainly did!" declared Jack Armitage.</p>

<p>"And do any of you still have any doubt about who it
was hiding away on that rotten old shelf up there, and listening
to all we did?" continued Elmer.</p>

<p>"I don't think you'd find any scout here willing to say
a contrary word, after the way you clinched things," remarked
Matty Eggleston.</p>

<p>"And you believe that was our old enemy, Matt
Tubbs?" Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"No other fellow could have made so quick a get-away,"
remarked Red Huggins, as he shook his fiery head in a
convincing way. "Mebbe I haven't seen him spin down
from first base many a time, and get there at second long
ahead of the ball. He can run some, that Matt Tubbs can.
Even Lil Artha will admit that."</p>

<p>"But whatever made him hide here?" queried Chatz
Maxfield.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, that's as plain as the nose on your face, Chatz,"
broke out Larry.</p>

<p>"I'd thank you, suh, to make no personal allusions to
my features," the hot-tempered Southern lad broke in.</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't mean anything by that," laughed Larry.
"But what else would tempt Matt Tubbs to hide in here,
except that he was aching to watch our meeting, and find
out how we did things. He reckoned we wouldn't be so
obliging as to ask him to be present, and as he's starting
a troop over in Fairfield, he wants to know how to run
things, so he can have the track greased."</p>

<p>"Well, he heard some straight-out talk, then, that ought
to do him a heap of good," remarked Matty.</p>

<p>"Aw! nothing would ever do that chump good; he's a
bad egg all over. Like as not he was just itching to do
something to give us a big scare. Say, perhaps he smashed
that loft down on purpose to frighten us!"</p>

<p>It was Tom Cropsey who offered this rather startling
suggestion; but the balance of the scouts were disposed to
make light of his idea.</p>

<p>"I don't think," jeered Red. "Matt Tubbs is tricky
and bold, but no one ever called him a fool, and that's what
he would be if he broke that loft down on purpose, and took
that tumble. Why, he might have broken his neck!"</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Toby. "When a feller is born
to be hung he could drop from the top of the highest tree,
and never feaze his neck."</p>

<p>"Toby knows, fellows," sang out Red. "Believe him,
he's a living example of the truth of that old saying. You
remember, some of you, how he fell off the roof of the
church that night, a year ago, when we were trying to get
in the belfry to ring the bell? Some fellows would have
had half a dozen of their slats caved in, even if they saved
their neck. What happened to Toby? Why, he dropped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
into that big bunch of cedars and only had a few scratches
to show for it. Yes, stake your faith on Toby; he knows
what he's talking about."</p>

<p>Of course shouts told that the boys appreciated getting
this one on Toby, who contented himself with shaking his
fist at Red, and grinning.</p>

<p>"But perhaps we don't all believe the same way," Elmer
remarked, after the clamor had died away, and all eyes
were turned again on him.</p>

<p>"Tell us what you think, Elmer?" asked several.</p>

<p>"Let us take it for granted then," said the scout-master,
"that the spy was Matt, and that he deliberately hid in
the old shop for the purpose of watching what we did; how
do we know that he had any real mean object in view? At
the best it has been only guess work, founded on his bad
reputation."</p>

<p>"That counts for a heap, I've found, to my cost," declared
Red, who for years had been unusually fond of
practical jokes and pranks, and several times floundered
in hot water because of this failing.</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is this," Elmer continued; "if
Matt Tubbs, or any other of the Fairfield boys, took the
trouble to walk all the way over from his home this evening,
four miles and more, just to get a chance to hide here, and
see what we did, he must be head over ears in earnest in
what he's got afoot. And, fellows, we happen to know that
means the new troop Fairfield is trying to organize."</p>

<p>Some nodded, as if he had carried them with him; a few
shook their heads, meaning to imply that their distrust of
the bully of Fairfield was so deep-seated that they would
have to be given stronger evidence than this if they were
expected to come around to Elmer's way of thinking.</p>

<p>"Well," the leader went on, "we may never know the
facts, but this I say, that if Matt Tubbs is trying to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a start along the right lines, we ought to do anything in our
power to help him. And if the chance opens, I promise
you I'm going to do that same thing, and not throw sticks
in his way."</p>

<p>"Hear! hear! that's the kind of talk that tells, Elmer!"
cried Mark.</p>

<p>Elmer had managed to secure possession of the cap that
had been found. He showed no manifestation of giving it
back again, and from the way he presently thrust the thing
in one of the pockets of his khaki coat, it was evident that
he had use for it.</p>

<p>None of the boys who noted this act thought it strange.
Elmer frequently did things that might not seem clear to
them on the surface, but they knew him well enough by this
time to feel confident that there was a motive worth while
back of the act, and which in good time would be made
plain.</p>

<p>The meeting soon broke up, the scouts heading toward the
town of Hickory Ridge, in regular formation of twos, with
Elmer and his closest chum, Mark, heading the line.</p>

<p>By degrees their number lessened as a boy would drop
out here, and another there, when the nearest point to their
several homes was reached.</p>

<p>"We had a fine meeting, eh, Mark?" said Elmer, as
the two stood for a few minutes on a corner ere separating.</p>

<p>"A dandy meeting," was the reply, given enthusiastically,
and with boyish vim.</p>

<p>"The addition of the four new recruits," Elmer went on,
"fills out our two patrols to their limit, and now we can
begin to drum up new names for the Eagle. By Fall we
ought to have six more good fellows come around, and finish
that patrol."</p>

<p>"Mr. Garrabrant will be pleased when he comes back and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
learns what we've done," Mark chuckled, as if he himself
were greatly overjoyed.</p>

<p>"That's so, because he's got the good of the troop at
heart," said the leader of the Wolf Patrol, earnestly.
"We're lucky to have such a wide-awake scout-master as
Mr. Garrabrant. A whole lot depends on what kind of a
man is in charge of the troop. They say, you know, Mark,
'as the twig's inclined the tree is bent'; and in most cases
you can judge the kind of troop by the caliber of the scout-master.
If he's weak there can be no order kept up. If
he's too severe the boys will rebel. I reckon it takes a
mighty smart man to handle twenty or thirty lively boys,
and get out the best they have in them."</p>

<p>"I've often thought of that, Elmer. I like to study
people, you remember. And I think all of our boys like
Mr. Garrabrant the best kind. Going to bed now? Well,
good night. See you to-morrow, if we get together, a dozen
of us, for that little hike."</p>

<p>And separating, the two chums headed for their several
homes.</p>

<p>On the following day Elmer, upon arriving at a place of
meeting in the morning, somewhere in the neighborhood of
nine o'clock, found a group of his fellow scouts anxiously
awaiting his coming. Most of them had come direct from
home, and each carried the staff that was supposed to be of
more or less help to the owner while on the road. This was
just six feet in length, stout, and in some instances made of
bamboo, and in others of clear ash; marked off in feet
and inches so that it could be used also for measuring distances,
being two meters in length, and with a grip for the
hand midway between the ends.</p>

<p>"Just ten here," remarked Elmer, after he had counted
the khaki-clad boys. "All who volunteered for the hike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
but one, and he, Red Huggins, usually as prompt a fellow as
there is in the troop, but behind time for once."</p>

<p>"Going to wait for him?" demanded one of the others,
impatient to be off.</p>

<p>"We'll give him the usual ten minutes allowance," replied
Elmer. "If he doesn't show up then, I suppose we'll
have to go without him."</p>

<p>He had noted one thing, and this was that neither of his
comrades of the preceding day had shown up. But then
Elmer had not expected they would. Practice had made
him almost immune to fatigue, after a ten mile walk, but
the same could not be said of Larry, and especially in the
case of little Jasper Merriweather.</p>

<p>On the whole, considering what excitement the boys had
endured on the previous day, Elmer thought they had done
very well. They must be feeling more or less stiff this
morning, and would need a lay-off. Besides, they had not
promised to get around to start on this walk.</p>

<p>Impatient Chatz took out a nickel watch, and began to
keep tabs on the passing of those ten minutes. The rest
chattered like magpies, and seemed to be pleased at the
idea of having a few hours with Elmer abroad. For the
young leader knew so many of the secrets of the great
out-doors, and was so ready to impart information to his
chums, that it was really a treat to be with him.</p>

<p>"Five minutes gone, and no sign of him yet, suh!" announced
the timekeeper, after a short interval, during
which all eyes were turned down the road, to the corner
around which it was expected the absent member would
come, should he show up at all.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, there are enough of us without Red;
though he's always good company on a hike," remarked
Lil Artha, who had really given up an anticipated trip
in an automobile over fifty miles of territory, just to accompany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Elmer in his hike, so great a fascination did the
new life have for the tall boy.</p>

<p>"I thought I thaw him right then, fellows!" exclaimed
Dr. Ted, pointing to a place where there was a gap in the
trees and fences.</p>

<p>Elmer nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Ted," he said. "I was wondering
whether anybody would notice that the road could be seen
through that little opening, and anyone coming discovered
some time before he reached the corner. That was Red,
I do believe; for I had a glimpse of him as he passed."</p>

<p>Ted Burgoyne looked satisfied. In fact, the boys had
reached a point by now when words of praise from the
assistant scout-master meant a whole lot to them, for it
always signified that something worth while had been done.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about it, but there was a heap
of thinking done; and no doubt every fellow present was
making up his mind to be more vigilant, so that he might
be the next to deserve favorable notice from the leader.</p>

<p>"You were right, Ted, for there he comes now," remarked
Toby, as a figure came around the corner.</p>

<p>It was Red Huggins, sure enough; and he seemed to be
hurrying.</p>

<p>"Knows he's late, and expects to be hauled over the
coals," chuckled Ty Collins.</p>

<p>Elmer said nothing. But he was watching the coming
of the late scout with an expression of rising curiosity on
his face. Truth to tell, he noted something that none of
the others had. Red Huggins looked more than "peeved"
because he was arriving late at the meeting-place, when a
scout is supposed to be always punctual to the minute. He
was worried, worked up over something or other!</p>

<p>"Hurry up here, old molasses in Winter!" called Lil
Artha. "Why, we were just going to leave you in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
lurch. What sort of an excuse can you give for holding
eleven comrades nearly ten minutes each? That means
more'n an hour wasted. It's a crying shame, that's what!"</p>

<p>Red had by now reached them. He was panting a little,
as though he might have run some distance, in order to
make up for lost time.</p>

<p>"Wasn't altogether my fault, fellows," he started to
explain.</p>

<p>"Oh! come now, no excuses are going to pass here!"
broke in Toby.</p>

<p>"Give him a chance to say what he wants to, boys," remarked
Elmer; and the late comer darted him a look of
thanks.</p>

<p>"I was just going to start out," Red began, "when
father came home. He had been out trying a new horse
he bought; and at first I thought he might have had a
runaway, he looked that excited. But one of our neighbors
came hurrying in, saying he had just heard the news
over the telephone, and asking father what it meant."</p>

<p>"News! What's that? Something happened since we
left home?" and the scouts began to look at each other,
while several grew a little white.</p>

<p>"Yes," Red went on, rapidly; "it happened that my
father was one of those who brought the news to town. I
got so stuck on what they were saying that I clean forgot
everything else; and that made me late. Then father saw
me in my scout uniform, and he said he wondered if Elmer
Chenowith, who was so smart about following a trail, could
lend a hand&mdash;that it seemed a job for the scouts, if ever
there was one!"</p>

<p>"Oh! speak out, and tell us what's happened!" cried
Toby, catching hold of Red by his sleeve and shaking him
a little.</p>

<p>"Well, you know Mrs. Gruber, the woman who lives in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that little house half a mile or so up the Jericho Road&mdash;she's
got just one child, a little girl, with the sunniest smile
and the prettiest golden hair you ever saw. Well, seems
like she separated from her husband, Dolph Gruber, because
of his bad habits. Father says Dolph came home last night,
made no end of a row, struck his wife, and went away with
little Ruth, saying her mother would never see her again.
And that's what he meant, fellows, when he said it was a
job for the scouts. Elmer, do you dare tackle it, and
try to get back that little girl again for her nearly
crazy mother?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOLLOWING A TRAIL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A dead</span> silence followed these startling words of Red
Huggins.</p>

<p>The party of scouts looked at one another, as though
their very breath might have been taken away by the
stunning news brought by the late comer.</p>

<p>Elmer was the first one to recover his wits; perhaps
because his nature proved to be a bit stronger than any
of the others; and then again it may have been through
the fact that he had had much more experience in grappling
with just such situations as the present.</p>

<p>"That father of yours was quite right, Red," he said.
"The chances are this is a job just suited to the scouts.
For what is the use of learning all those things about
tracking through the woods, if you can't make use of them
when an occasion comes along."</p>

<p>"Do we go, Elmer?" demanded Lil Artha, eagerly, his
face lighting up.</p>

<p>"Say yes, Elmer!" cried the impulsive Red. "Oh!
father declares that poor woman is nearly out of her mind
with fear of what her bad husband may do with the little
girl. You know it isn't his child at all, really; he is her
second husband. Her name used to be Tubbs."</p>

<p>"What? I didn't know that before!" exclaimed Elmer,
staring at the speaker.</p>

<p>"But that won't make any difference, will it, because
she happens to be some relation to Matt?" asked Toby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"I know the girl, Ruth; and as Red says, she's a little
fairy, an angel. Let's go, fellows!"</p>

<p>"Of course we'll go, and try to do the best we can to
get back the child," Elmer remarked, as he shut his teeth
hard. "I've heard a good deal about this Dolph Gruber;
and every one says he's a hard nut. But there are a dozen
of us, fellows, and I reckon we ought to be a match for one
coward. I call him that because none but a miserable
drunkard and a coward would act as he has done, striking
his wife, and carrying off her child, with such a horrible
threat."</p>

<p>"Then let's be off right away," said Red, in his impatient
way.</p>

<p>"Fall in, and we'll go on the double-quick, up the Jericho
Road," called Elmer.</p>

<p>Mark was along, bugle and all, even though this hike
which they had planned was not looked upon as a troop
affair, and no one was under any compulsion to enter for
the long walk.</p>

<p>Circumstances entirely unexpected had suddenly caused
an entire change in their program; but accustomed to
meeting emergencies as they arose, Elmer was just as ready
to take up the new scheme.</p>

<p>No doubt he was more or less thrilled with pleasure to
think that Mr. Huggins, who was quite an important man
in the affairs of Hickory Ridge, should consider him able
to grapple with this situation.</p>

<p>Others might start to scouring the surrounding country,
in hopes of cutting the scoundrel off, and effecting his
arrest. But if Dolph Gruber were as keen-witted as he
was given credit for being, he would likely avoid beaten
paths, and keep to the timber, thus preventing these searchers
from getting in touch with him.</p>

<p>Of course Elmer could hardly believe the man was bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
enough to think of really injuring little Ruth. He probably
meant to punish his wife for refusing to longer hand
over to him some of the money she received from relatives,
by carrying her child away, and keeping the little girl
concealed, until the mother promised to come to terms, and
pay a ransom.</p>

<p>But at the same time his act was that of a fiend; and
Elmer's boyish heart was filled with indignation as he in
imagination could see the poor mother weeping because
her little one was gone, leaving her to fear all sorts of terrible
things.</p>

<p>Yes, this was surely a case for the scouts. If ever their
knowledge of woodcraft promised to be of value it must be
now. Dolph could not go very far without leaving some
sort of a trail behind him. And as he was apt to shun the
roads and beaten paths through the woods, they could the
easier follow him. Half a mile is a very short distance
when boys are in a hurry.</p>

<p>"There's the house right now!" called out one sharp-eyed
scout, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there's a crowd of people around, too!" declared
another. "Must have got the news around mighty
quick. Say, there comes a wagon racing along from over
Fairfield way; and I just bet you it's got Matt and his dad
in it, too."</p>

<p>"Just what it has, fellows," declared Ty. "Looks like
we were just bound to run across that Matt everywhere
we went, don't it? And here comes a car from Hickory
Ridge, with a lot of people in it. Looky there, some of
'em are the officers. Yep, here they come right after us.
Make way, fellows, if you don't want to get run over!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later, and they brought up at the cottage
which had so suddenly become such a center of interest.
The phone had been used from Hickory Ridge to inform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Mr. Tubbs, who was a big contractor in Fairfield. Others
had come from various neighboring homes, for it is amazing
how such news flies on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>The boys moved around among the people for a short
time. Elmer made his way inside the cottage, to where
he could hear the bereaved mother crying, and between sobs
trying the best she could to tell just how it had happened.</p>

<p>"If we only knew which way Dolph went, we might
manage to head him off," declared the police head, after
a while.</p>

<p>"Oh! if you only could, how happy I would be!" Mrs.
Gruber cried, stopping her crying to wring her hands entreatingly.
"He is a bad man when he drinks; and he was
in a terrible temper because I said I couldn't get him
any more money&mdash;that my folks wouldn't allow me to turn
over another cent to him. Please start right away; and if
you bring back my Ruth unharmed I will pray for you
every night of my whole life!"</p>

<p>"But how are we to know which way he went?" questioned
the officer. "You say he struck you, ma'am, and
that you fell down almost insensible. But can you not
give us some sort of clue as to which direction he took?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I can," came the eager reply. "Please come
outside with me. You see, I seemed to recover after a
little, and being almost crazy to know what he had done
with my darling Ruth, I managed to crawl out of the door
here, though I was so dizzy I could hardly keep from falling.
Then I saw him carrying my child in his arms, and
just disappearing in the woods over there, close to where
you see that dark hemlock, under which," with another
choking sob, "she used to play so often."</p>

<p>"Sure of that, are you, ma'am?" asked the man in uniform,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I assure you it is the exact truth, sir. Under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that hemlock I saw them disappear," the distracted mother
cried.</p>

<p>"I understand what he had in his mind," broke in a
man. "That's a short cut to the other road that leads over
to Cramertown. Dolph used to live there once. So of
course he's heading that way."</p>

<p>To be sure it seemed most reasonable, and not one of
the men appeared to doubt the accuracy of the guess in the
least. But Elmer was not so sure. He knew that when a
man becomes by some act of his own a fugitive from the
law, he changes his ways. Cramertown, then, would be
one of the last places to which Dolph Gruber would think
of fleeing, because he was well known there.</p>

<p>"Then, seems like the best thing we could do, gents,"
declared the officer, with a show of cunning in his manner,
"would be to jump aboard the car again, and make around
the road for Cramertown. If he ain't there yet, perhaps
he'll be along before a great while; and we can lay a
trap for Dolph. Jump aboard, those that are going. Cramertown
it is, boys. And we'll bring back the little gal,
sure as you're born."</p>

<p>The car was speedily filled with eager hunters, and went
spinning down the road headed for the forks some two
miles away, where they could change their course, and
reach the object of their ambition.</p>

<p>Some of the scouts had looked as though they wanted to
accompany the party in the car, but Elmer made no movement
in that quarter, and so of course the others would
not think of taking matters in their own hands. Besides,
they were anxious to see what their leader meant to do.</p>

<p>Waiting until the car and its load had vanished in a
cloud of dust, Elmer made a swift movement with his arm
to his followers. Then the entire dozen hurried off, heading
exactly toward the hemlock which Mrs. Gruber had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
twice stated was the point where she had had the last
glimpse of the kidnaper.</p>

<p>"Now we'll see whether scout tactics are worth anything,"
observed Lil Artha, to Landy Smith and Phil Dale,
the two new members who had come along to begin their
experiences as scouts; although neither of them was in the
regulation uniform as yet, because the tailor, Jasper's
father, had not been able to commence their suits of khaki.</p>

<p>Of course these two boys were watching everything that
occurred, with eyes round with wonder. They were of the
observing kind, and would doubtless quickly grasp the fact
that a scout must keep eyes and ears on the alert, if he
hoped to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the hemlock, all right," observed Toby,
"and now, fellows, stand back till Elmer has a chance to
look over the ground. So many feet might tramp out
the trail Dolph must have left."</p>

<p>They watched Elmer as he bent over. He moved this
way and that, as his eyes scanned the ground in the most
likely places. Twice he seemed to turn over some twigs,
or fallen foliage that had turned brown.</p>

<p>"He sees it!" exclaimed Lil Artha; and Matt echoed
the words, for he, too, had noticed that Elmer was now
actually moving on.</p>

<p>"Want us to tag along after you, Elmer?" called Mark,
eagerly.</p>

<p>By a movement of his arm the leader announced that
he did.</p>

<p>"Go slow now, fellows," warned Mark. "Don't anybody
overrun him, and cut across the trail. Leave it to
Elmer just now. If he wants us to help him he'll sing out
all in good time."</p>

<p>"That goes, Mark," echoed Red; and in this way then
the dozen scouts began to move along through the woods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
losing sight of the road, and the cottage where the mourning
mother continued to weep and pray.</p>

<p>Presently they saw that Elmer had changed his course.
He was no longer heading directly into the west as at
first, but had sheered more into the northwest.</p>

<p>"Begins to look like Elmer was right, and the police
head wrong," remarked Matty.</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Landy Smith, filled with curiosity
as to what it meant.</p>

<p>"Why," Matt went on, "you remember that the man
said he believed Dolph was heading for the road that would
take him to Cramertown. Now, Elmer, he believed just
the opposite, and that pretty soon Dolph would turn off to
go deeper into the timber. And that's just what he seems
to be doing, the slick skunk."</p>

<p>"Say, this thing keeps growing more exciting, the further
you dip into it," declared Landy. "Already I'm
dead sure I'm going to get heaps of fun out of the scout
business. And after a while, perhaps we'll even run this
fellow Dolph down."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," asserted Toby, confidently. "Just stake
your faith on Elmer to do the little job. Yes, sir, we expect
that to happen, sooner or later."</p>

<p>"And when you do, there's going to be some sort of a
mix-up," continued Landy.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't be surprised," replied Toby, glancing at
the new member queerly, for he saw Landy was excited.</p>

<p>"Hark to me, Toby," said the other, almost in a whisper;
"if that thing does come around, perhaps you'll all
be glad I brought this little machine along," and he exhibited
a revolver to the astonished gaze of the other.</p>

<p>"Hold on here," said Toby. "You ought to know that
it's against the rules of the scouts, and our troop in particular,
to carry a pistol. Nobody but the scout-master has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that privilege. And to save you from trouble you'd better
tell Elmer right off."</p>

<p>Others of the boys had seen what Landy held, and of
course their exclamations reached the ears of the leader,
who turned back.</p>

<p>"Against the rules, Landy," he said, smiling; "but
since you're a new member, I won't throw it away. Here,
let me empty out all the cartridges. You haven't any more
with you, I suppose? Well, an empty revolver can't do
any great harm. But be sure not to bring it again."</p>

<p>"But it might have come in handy right now, in case
Dolph Gruber turned out to be ugly," protested Landy,
regretfully replacing the shiny thing in his pocket, with a
shame-faced air.</p>

<p>"Oh! well," said Elmer, as he started off again on the
trail, "if twelve husky scouts can't manage one man, they'd
better call themselves squaws, and put on skirts; that's
all. Come on, fellows!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>REASONING THAT LOOKED LIKE MAGIC.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two new scouts, Landy Smith and Phil Dale, watched
every action of Elmer with wonder and the deepest interest.</p>

<p>"I never knew before there was so much in this business,"
the former kept declaring to Matty, who chanced
to keep near him. "Why, he doesn't seem to have any
great trouble finding where Dolph went along, and yet
for the life of me I can't see a blessed sign of a footprint."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Matty, "for that matter neither can
some of the rest of us, but we're keen to learn; and I know
I'm picking up new points all the time. You see Elmer
lived away out in the Canadian Great West, where he
mixed up with cowboys, hunters and all such chaps. That's
where he learned lots of things that just fit in the scouting
line like pie."</p>

<p>"What's he going to do now?" demanded Landy, seeing
their leader coming to a sudden halt, and waving for the
others to approach.</p>

<p>"He wants to show us something," replied Matty.
"You see, Elmer is anxious that every member of the
troop, whether he belongs to the Wolf Patrol, the Beaver,
or the new Eagle that is being formed, shall be as well
posted in woodcraft as he is himself. So even while we're
following up this trail, bent on business, he finds interesting
things now and then to explain to us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>As the entire group of scouts gathered around where the
leader bent over the ground, Elmer pointed downward,
saying:</p>

<p>"Here's something, fellows, that I thought you ought
to take note of. It may be of considerable benefit to you
at some time or other, when perhaps you're passing through
a test of trail following. I suppose every one of you can
see this plain track of Dolph's shoe here?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" replied a number of the boys, readily enough;
for evidently Elmer had picked out a particularly prominent
impression when starting in to paint his little lesson.</p>

<p>"I'm going to hazard the declaration that this track
was made about seven this morning; that at the time Dolph
was carrying the little girl in his arms, and probably holding
his hand over her mouth in order to prevent her crying
out loud so as to attract attention."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, that's a whole heap to say, Elmer,"
remarked Toby; although the expression on his face was
rather that of eagerness to hear more, than doubt concerning
the ability of Elmer to make good his assertion.</p>

<p>As for the two new scouts, they were beyond saying anything,
but could only gasp and exchange looks.</p>

<p>"Now, you are wondering how I know those three
things," Elmer went on. "And perhaps some of you are
thinking that I asked Mrs. Gruber what time it was when
Dolph came home, and acted like a brute. But I didn't;
and only know, like the rest of you, that it was some time
this morning. But I happened to remember that there
was a queer little shower early this morning. It stopped
as suddenly as it began. All the way up to here I could
see signs of water in the tracks, but you notice there are
none in these footprints now. That shower quit at five
minutes to seven in Hickory Ridge. Making allowance for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the difference in distance, I reckon Dolph was right here
when it let up, say at even seven."</p>

<p>"Gee! that's going some!" muttered Landy, who was
listening with rapt attention.</p>

<p>"Now, about his carrying the girl&mdash;that's easy. The
soil is so soft right here, that it would show even the small
print of her shoes. I saw them just back yonder, where
we passed the big oak tree, but there's never a sign here.
It stands to reason Dolph wouldn't turn the child loose;
and so he must have picked her up."</p>

<p>"Because she was getting worn out, do you think, Elmer?"
asked Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, that may have been the cause; and yet, perhaps,
he had another reason, which brings me to the third statement
I made. He was holding his hand over her mouth!
I'm only making a bold stab at that, fellows, and if you
pay attention I'll try to explain on what I base my views."</p>

<p>"Sure we will, Elmer; you've got us all tuned up to
top notch," remarked Red.</p>

<p>"And as for me," said Landy, helplessly, "I'm in a
fog, drifting about, and not knowing where I'll land. For
the life of me I can't see how you figure out such wonderful
things, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Listen, then," went on the acting scout master, "up
to near here the trail led along in a direct track. I could
see that Dolph was following some line he had no doubt
marked out for himself. Then suddenly he had darted
aside. That was where he grabbed up the child, if the
tracks stood for anything. Do you see where he began to
move along so as to keep this fringe of bushes in front?
All right. Mark, you walk over to that big clump, and tell
me if there isn't plain marks there showing where Dolph
knelt down. You can't mistake the impression of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
knees, and where the toes of his shoes dug into the soil
two feet below."</p>

<p>Mark thereupon hastened to obey, while the balance of
the scouts awaited his report with mingled feelings of
anxiety and hope.</p>

<p>They saw him bend over as though keenly observing.</p>

<p>Then Mark straightened up. His face was smiling, as
he called out triumphantly:</p>

<p>"By all that's wonderful they're here, just as you said
they would be, Elmer. I know a man knelt down as well
as if I saw him. And wait, here's the tracks of little shoes
again, just beside him."</p>

<p>"I supposed you would find <i>her</i> trail there," resumed
Elmer, quietly, "because it stood to reason that as Dolph
crouched down behind the bushes he would drop her on
the ground; all the while, remember, possibly holding his
hand over Ruth's little mouth to keep her from betraying
him."</p>

<p>"If that don't beat the Dutch!" ejaculated Landy.
"Do you mean to tell me you read all that just from the
signs? After this I'll believe anything. Why, a fellow'd
think you'd been right on the spot, and actually watched
Dolph."</p>

<p>"But see here, Elmer," spoke up Red Huggins, perhaps
thinking to get the leader in a hole, or else honestly seeking
further enlightenment; "what ever made Dolph act in that
silly way? Do you think he was going out of his head,
and believin' the police were hot on his trail?"</p>

<p>Elmer smiled.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that, Red," he remarked, "and
come to this conclusion. He must have heard voices, or
else caught the sound of wheels over in that direction, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
you see that he dropped down behind the bushes on the
east side, showing the danger must have been to the west!"</p>

<p>All of the boys turned and stared in that quarter.</p>

<p>"Matty," said Elmer, "while the rest of us stay right
here, suppose you start off directly west of this. Don't go
out of sight; and unless my theory is all wrong you won't
have to. Because I'll be mighty much surprised if you
don't run across a road pretty quick!"</p>

<p>Of course Matty Eggleston made the utmost haste to
comply with the directions of his chief. As leader of the
Beaver Patrol he was decidedly interested in everything
that pertained to woodcraft, and the way in which Elmer
was showing the wonders of the forest trailer's art captivated
him.</p>

<p>The rest of the scouts stood there, all eyes following the
form of their companion as he made his way between the
trees, avoiding such bushes as impeded his forward movements.</p>

<p>Would he find that the supposition of the trail follower
was correct? Was there a road so close to them, hidden by
the thick undergrowth?</p>

<p>Suddenly Matty whirled around. He made a gesture that
told of delight almost beyond his ability to express. And
then they heard his shout.</p>

<p>"Here's your old road, Elmer, I declare if it ain't, just
as you said!"</p>

<p>"Bully for Elmer!" exclaimed the impulsive Red.</p>

<p>"Say, you've been up in this region before, haven't you,
Elmer?" asked Phil Dale, who seemed to be the "Doubting
Thomas" of the little flock; for these were things so
remarkable he must believe the scout-master knew beforehand,
or else was playing a practical joke on his comrades.</p>

<p>"Never in all my life," replied Elmer, and Phil believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
him; then elevating his voice the leader called out: "Go
on, and get to the road, Matty. I want you to take a look,
and tell me if you can see the marks of rubber tires there
in the mud or dust."</p>

<p>A minute later and the other shouted back:</p>

<p>"Just as sure as you live, fellows, I've found the marks
where a car rushed past. Must have gone at a pretty sharp
clip, too, because it sent the mud flying from this little
depression here."</p>

<p>"Let's get over there with Matty," remarked Elmer.
"We can come back here afterward and take up the trail
again."</p>

<p>Two minutes later and the scouts stood on the road. It
was only a country road, and not a general thoroughfare.
Few vehicles passed during the day, and apparently it must
be a sort of connecting link between turnpikes that ran
parallel.</p>

<p>"The car was going in the same direction we are
headed," announced Elmer, after looking at the marks.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be blessed if I can see how you found that
out," declared Phil, as he shook his head and looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing could be more simple," declared Elmer.
"In a case of this kind all a scout has to do is to keep his
wits about him, and look sharp. Now, just as Matty guessed
that this car was hitting up a pretty good pace when it
went past, because it threw the soft mud to some little
distance when it dashed through this puddle, so I examine
some of the splashes on the leaves here by the roadside.
And as you see, fellows, they are, without a single exception,
all on this one side of leaves and the trunks of
these close-by trees. Do you get on now, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, you <i>are</i> a wonder, Elmer Chenowith!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
exclaimed the other, as his face lighted up. "I used to
think it was only guesswork, this reading tracks; but now
I can see that it's all figured out just like you'd get an
algebra problem in school. Given one thing, and the other
must follow dead sure. Of course that car was going north!
It couldn't be anything else, because these mud splashes
are every one on the south side of the leaves and trees."</p>

<p>"Well, this has been an eye-opener to me, fellows!" declared
Landy, earnestly. "And I give you fair notice right
now that I'm going to know a heap more about this fine
business before I've been long in the Beaver Patrol."</p>

<p>"I say, Elmer, do you mean to tell us this car which
Dolph heard coming, and hid to escape being seen&mdash;that
it was the one we saw start out for Cramertown?" asked
Red.</p>

<p>"No, it couldn't have been, for a good many reasons.
That car didn't leave the cottage of Mrs. Gruber till just
before we did, and that was plumb nine. You remember,
I think I proved by the rain token, that Dolph was here
at seven. So it must have been another car entirely&mdash;perhaps
some people going to Rockaway or Hickory Ridge,
and in a hurry. But Dolph, hearing them coming, and
being afraid by reason of his guilt, hid behind the bushes,
and, I imagine, must have clapped a hand over little Ruth's
mouth. If the men in the machine heard a child's cry
they might want to jump out and investigate, and Dolph
wasn't going to take any chances."</p>

<p>"All this is mighty interesting, Elmer," said Mark;
"and we think you've proved every point you made.
What comes next on the program?"</p>

<p>"Back to the trail, and keep right along. Sooner or
later I expect we're going to run this scoundrel to earth
and make a prisoner of him. But he's got several hours'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
start of us yet," Elmer replied, leaving the road that had
told them so much, and aiming once more for the clump of
bushes where the impression of Dolph's two knees could
be so plainly seen.</p>

<p>"But unless he's a regular trotter he ain't going to keep
on the go long," remarked Lil Artha, confidently.</p>

<p>"Not much," declared Ted Burgoyne. "You thee,
he's got that little girl along, and it thtands to reason
Ruth ith about played out right here. Tho, fellows, the
chances are Dolph he'll have to just pick her up and carry
her. And with thuch a load why he'll thoon get tired and
camp. That's where we'll have the hunch on him."</p>

<p>"Yes," Elmer went on, "I quite agree with Ted there,
and expect that before another hour at least we'll run on
our game."</p>

<p>Once more, then, he led the way, with an interested and
enthusiastic bunch of scouts trailing close at his heels.</p>

<p>Frequently there would arise little problems that had
to be solved. Now it was an apparent absence of marks,
showing that the ground had grown more rocky, and no
footprint appeared. Then again, Dolph followed a worn
trail, so that it was necessary to make sure he stuck to
this.</p>

<p>Elmer was equal to each and every demand upon his
knowledge. When none of the other boys could discover
a sign of tracks, he pointed out to where a stone had been
overturned since the little shower had passed; or it might
be calling their attention to a broken twig, a bruised leaf
that had been trodden on, or in various other ways proved
his point, as was made clear when a little later they would
again run upon the footprints left by Dolph.</p>

<p>They had now come quite some distance, and a few of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the fellows were showing signs of wishing to rest up for
a brief interval. Elmer himself could stand any amount
of fatigue without giving way, but there were untrained
muscles among the scouts; and after all it was not so vital
that they rush things.</p>

<p>"Here, let's rest for ten minutes or so, fellows," he
remarked, as they came to a little bluff about fifteen or
twenty feet in height, at the foot of which the trail seemed
to run.</p>

<p>The boys threw themselves down on the ground, some
of them glad of the chance to recuperate without having
to show the white feather. It was very thoughtful of the
leader, to be sure, displaying this regard for their natural
pride.</p>

<p>"He sure can't be a great ways from here, Elmer?"
remarked Matty. "Seems to me the trail has been growing
fresher lately."</p>

<p>"That's right, it has," replied the other, nodding his
head. "One place I found where Dolph had rested, I
don't know how long, but perhaps half an hour; for the
child walked again after they started, as if refreshed by
the stop."</p>

<p>"Then we're apt to run on them any old time now?"
suggested Toby, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Just what we are," Elmer answered, as he kept his
face turned upward toward the top of the little bluff
overhead.</p>

<p>"What you looking at, Elmer?" demanded Red Huggins,
half starting up.</p>

<p>"Just cast your eyes up where that clump of grass
grows, fellows," the leader said, pointing his finger; "I
thought I saw something moving there, and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>What he meant to say remained unspoken, for just then
a slice of the edge of the bluff suddenly gave way, and
amid a mass of earth a human figure came rolling down the
sharp incline!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GIVING MATT TUBBS A CHANCE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Whoop!</span> it's that Dolph, fellows!" cried Red, jumping
to his feet, and showing signs of being prepared to fight
if necessary; though scouts are supposed to resort to such
methods only in cases of absolute necessity, and then generally
in defense of some one weaker than themselves.</p>

<p>"Look at him turning somersaults, would you?"
shouted Landy.</p>

<p>"Oh! my stars, what a header! He'll break his neck,
sure!" exclaimed Toby.</p>

<p>The tumbling figure, with arms and legs flying every
which way, landed in a heap close beside the bunch of
startled scouts, every one of whom was now erect, and observing
the dusty intruder with staring eyes.</p>

<p>"Wow! look at him, fellows! We've sure seen that gent
before!" said Red, as the unfortunate spy sat up, and
dug his knuckles into his eyes as if to clear them of the
dust.</p>

<p>His nose was bleeding more or less, and he showed other
signs of rough treatment; but apparently he had not been
seriously hurt by his fall.</p>

<p>"It's Matt Tubbs!" remarked Elmer, with a smile, as
though after all he was not so very much astonished at the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>"Say, however did that chump get here?" demanded
Toby.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me, all right," remarked the object of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
attention, with rather a sickly grin, as he started to get out
a handkerchief to apply to his bleeding nose; "anyhow,
it's what's left of me after that nasty tumble."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt bad, Matt?" demanded Dr. Ted, scenting
an opportunity to practice his arts of healing; "because
if you feel that you've broken a leg, or your collar bone,
call on me for help. Won't charge you a cent either.
Glad to cut off a limb or do any little favor. Don't be
bashful, now; just thspeak up."</p>

<p>"Oh! rats, I ain't hurt so bad as that! I reckon I kin
get up all right," and as he spoke Matt proceeded to prove
the truth of his assertion by scrambling to his feet, though
he winced a little as he did so.</p>

<p>"Where'd you ever come from?" demanded Matty.
"We felt sure you'd gone off in that car with your father
and the police, headed for Cramertown. Say, are they
near here; and did they turn back?"</p>

<p>"Naw," grunted Matt. "I jumped out after I got to
thinkin' about it. Seemed to me after what I saw Elmer
Chenowith do yesterday up at the place of my aunt, that
he'd be more apt to find that pesky Dolph Gruber than a
pack of noisy cops. So I just follered the bunch, that's
all."</p>

<p>And strange to say, Elmer felt more pride over hearing
one who had been an enemy speak these words of praise
than he would have been had his chums gone into ecstasies
over his work as a trailer. He believed he knew what was
going on in that mind of Matt. And he was not at all
sorry for it, either. It might mean great things in the
near future for both the Fairfield boys, and those of the
Hickory Ridge troop.</p>

<p>"D'ye mean to tell us, Matt, you've been dodging after
us right along, and none of us saw you?" demanded Red.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fairfield bully grinned; and as his broad face was
by this time pretty well smeared with traces of blood, he
presented a queer appearance while so doing.</p>

<p>"All the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'samee'">same</ins>, that's just what I done, Red," he declared.
"Sometimes I was that clost I heard every word
you fellers said. Then agin I dropped back, when the
cover got thinner. An' right here let me say I was huggin'
the ground all the time Elmer, he says such great things
about the trail, an' the ottermobile on that road. Never
knowed there could be so much diskivered by just peekin'
at footprints. Gosh! 'twas great, that's what."</p>

<p>"Well, where are you going?" asked Toby, between
whom and the Fairfield bully there was a long standing
grudge.</p>

<p>"Same as you fellers, I reckon," grinned Matt.</p>

<p>"He means he wants to stick along with us, boys," remarked
Red.</p>

<p>"Just like his impudence!" snarled Chatz, unable to
bring himself to believe there was an atom of good in this
hulking Fairfield leader, who had many a time started a
fight when the boys of the rival towns tried to compete
on the diamond, the gridiron, or at hockey on the ice of
the Sweetwater River.</p>

<p>Matt heard these remarks, which were none too complimentary.
He seemed to have made up his mind not to
pay any attention to them, much as they must have set his
fighting blood to coursing hotly through his veins.</p>

<p>His eyes were fastened on Elmer alone, as though he recognized
the fact of his leadership, and that what he said
was apt to go.</p>

<p>Elmer made up his mind immediately. He considered
that this was too good an opportunity to be lost. Matt, the
rough and ready fighter of the neighboring town, was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the crossroads. A very little thing would turn him one
way or the other. He might be said to be groping in the
dark. And what scout worthy of the name would forget
his vows, and turn a cold shoulder upon a seeker after
light?</p>

<p>So he turned toward Matt a face that was filled with
encouragement; and even before the leader of the Wolf
Patrol had spoken a single word Matt realized that his
case was as good as won.</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling us, Matt," said Elmer, pleasantly,
"just why you want to go along with us now?"</p>

<p>"Sure not," came the ready answer. "I said, didn't
I, that when I saw what blundering fools them jay cops
were, I believed there was a heap more chance of Elmer
trackin' Dolph Gruber? Well, that's one reason why I
want to go along; 'cause I reckon you're just goin' to get
that critter, while the police are waitin' for him to show
up in Cramertown, where he never meant to go at all."</p>

<p>"But, Matt, there is another reason?" persisted Elmer.</p>

<p>"There be," replied the bully, with one of his grins.</p>

<p>"Tell us what it is," asked Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, you fellers know we're startin' a troop over in
Fairfield, don't you?" Matt replied. "I've heard a lot
'bout what this here Elmer Chenowith knowed concernin'
woodcraft an' such things. When I seen him take holt of
my uncle yest'day, and fix him up just like a reg'lar doctor
might, when I didn't know the fust blamed thing to
do, says I to myself, says I, 'It's time you was findin' out
all 'bout what this here scout business means; 'cause thar's
a heap more connected with it than fightin'.' An' I want
to be along to see what else Elmer kin show us, when the
trail she grows dim. There seems to be somethin' in here,"
and he clapped a hand on his breast, "that just <i>wants</i> to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
larn 'bout these things. Never felt just this way afore,
give you my word I ain't. Kin I go, Elmer?"</p>

<p>The scout leader gave a quick glance at his chums. Several
nodded, hardly knowing themselves why they did it,
save that somehow they had been affected by what the
bully of Fairfield had just said.</p>

<p>"I don't think a single scout will raise any objection to
your keeping along with us, Matt," Elmer said, seriously.
"Only for the time being you must promise to be bound
by the same rules that the rest are."</p>

<p>"Promise anything, Elmer, so's you let me go 'long,"
declared the other. "Now what d'ye want of me?"</p>

<p>"Only that you agree to obey orders," Elmer said.</p>

<p>"Whose orders?" demanded Matt, quickly.</p>

<p>"I happen to represent our scout-master, Mr. Garrabrant,"
answered the leader of the Wolf Patrol; "and in
his absence the members of the troop look to me to command."</p>

<p>Matt grinned some more, and nodded cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Sure I'll do whatever <i>you</i> say while I'm along, Elmer,"
he declared. "And when we ketch up with that coward
Dolph, I hope you set me on him. I'm just boiling over
for a fight; and he'll get his medicine or else my name is
Mud."</p>

<p>"That's just it, Matt," remarked Elmer. "We hope
not to have to fight at all, if we can manage to get the
child away from her stepfather. But one thing I will
promise you, Matt&mdash;if there should be any need of strong-arm
action, I'll call on you to do your share. You'll be
on the firing line."</p>

<p>"All right, Elmer; and now forget I'm along, and just
go on like you would if I hadn't come tumbling down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that pesky slope like a bag of oats. Wow! my elbows must
be skinned to beat the band."</p>

<p>And Elmer knew full well that after that his every movement
would be watched by Matt with the utmost eagerness.
A new world was opening up to this rough boy of Fairfield;
through the open door he was beginning to catch enticing
glimpses of things he had never dreamed existed on this
earth. And Elmer could not find it in his heart to close
that door that was ajar.</p>

<p>So they started again.</p>

<p>Whenever there came a brief halt, as the trailer found a
temporary hitch in his work, Matt Tubbs invariably pressed
to the front, and had eyes and ears only for the one whom
he had begun to take as his pattern. And knowing his
utter ignorance along the line of reading signs, Elmer took
especial pains to explain just why he did this thing or that.</p>

<p>It was an object lesson that was apt to prove invaluable
to every fellow who clustered around "the boy who knew."
Besides the information they thus picked up, the fascination
of the thing appealed strongly to their inquiring
minds; and as a consequence, every fellow would make it a
point to study the gentle arts of woodcraft more and more,
as opportunities for doing so arose.</p>

<p>They had gone possibly another mile when Elmer came
to a halt, and raised his hand in a way that told his companions
he wanted them to stop.</p>

<p>"No noise, please, now, fellows," he said, in a low tone;
and the manner of his saying this struck most of the scouts
as highly significant.</p>

<p>"Thay, are we near him now?" asked Ted, in a hoarse
whisper&mdash;he had been keeping close to Matt all the while,
from time to time suggesting something in the way of relief
from the aches and pains the Fairfield boy was suffering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
even to the extent of promising to bind up his skinned
elbows at the first chance.</p>

<p>"I believe we are," replied the leader, in the same cautious
voice; "in fact, he may right now be within a hundred
yards of where we are standing!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AT MCGRAW's LUMBER CAMP.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one said anything immediately.</p>

<p>Although every scout had been showing more or less
signs of impatience, and was wishing that they would soon
come upon the fugitive who had kidnaped the sweet child
of Mrs. Gruber, now that the critical moment seemed near
at hand they found themselves attacked with a queer little
case of shivers.</p>

<p>Had Elmer's opinion been asked as to what this meant,
he might have compared it to the "buck fever" that usually
assails a greenhorn on the occasion of his getting his
first chance to shoot a deer. It was sheer nervousness, that
was all.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the leader as though they
looked to him to say just what was next on their program.</p>

<p>"I want you to settle down here and wait for me," he
remarked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Does that mean you're going to creep forward and try
and glimpse the camp of the enemy?" asked Mark, regretfully;
for he would have liked to share this duty with his
chum, if possible.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other. "From signs I've been noticing
along the way lately, I've got a hunch that we're close
to that old logging camp I've heard tell of ever since I came
to Hickory Ridge. You know it's been deserted now for
some ten years because all the big timber was cut that
could be moved to the river. Most of this around here is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
second growth, though a few big trees were left as being
crooked or something else."</p>

<p>"You must mean McGraw's Camp!" remarked Mark.</p>

<p>"That was what they used to call it in the old days; and
in those times these woods saw some lively goings-on, I
understand," Elmer continued.</p>

<p>"I should just say they did," remarked Red. "I've
heard my father tell of the awful fights that used to happen
every winter up here."</p>

<p>"Say, I was up at McGraw's Camp once about three
years ago," broke in Toby. "My folks were out driving
and we got lost, bringin' up in the camp. Why, we even
had to spend a whole night there, gettin' out the next day.
Whee! wasn't ma scared, though? She thought we was all
going to be devoured by panthers and bears. Dad, he had
to sit up all night in the shanty, keep a fire goin' and guard
the door. Every little while she'd pop up and look 'round,
like she'd been dreamin' a whole army of wildcats and
other varmints had come down the chimbly flue."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your knowledge of the camp may come in
handy for us, if we have to use strategy to capture Dolph,"
suggested Elmer; and immediately Toby swelled out his
chest as though he felt that he must henceforth assume
great importance in the carrying out of the plan of campaign.</p>

<p>"Now, don't anybody move while I'm gone, remember,"
said Elmer, in a general way, but with his eye fixed particularly
upon Matt Tubbs.</p>

<p>"Nixy for me, Elmer," remarked that worthy, in a low,
husky tone. "I'm goin' to lay right here and wait till
you come back; that's me."</p>

<p>"And perhaps it might be ath well, Matt, if you allowed
me to thee those elbows of yours while we're waiting," said
Dr. Ted, officiously edging closer to his prospective patient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"It happens, you thee, that I've got thome excellent thalve
along with me. Brought it, not knowing what might happen
on a hike. It'll be a good thing, and take thome of
the pain out; besides, it's just great to thstart wounds to
healing."</p>

<p>"Get busy then, Doc," grinned Matt, peeling off his torn
coat, and rolling up both his sleeves.</p>

<p>The act disclosed the badly lacerated elbows; indeed so
painful did they appear that some of the scouts could not
keep from uttering exclamations of dismay; but Matt was
made of stern stuff, and at least affected to look at his
wounds with indifference.</p>

<p>Dr. Ted started to work and made considerable of an
impression on the rough bully of Fairfield, while he was
softly rubbing the ointment on, and then insisting on wrapping
a piece of linen, which he pulled out from one of his
pockets, around each elbow to keep the wound clean, he said,
though Matt declared he wanted his arms free for immediate
service.</p>

<p>"There, don't that feel much better?" demanded Ted,
when he had completed his job; and Matt drew the sleeves
of his torn shirt down again.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Ted; and I'm 'bliged to you. Ain't
nawthin' that bothers a feller <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'more's'">more'n</ins> a skinned elbow, I
reckon; and I've had lots of 'em."</p>

<p>"I've heard of one thing that beats a skinned elbow,"
declared Red.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know," remarked Matt, looking up from
under his heavy brows inquiringly at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Why, two skinned elbows, I guess!" chuckled Red, at
which the other only grinned as if able to take a joke.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elmer had made his way cautiously along in
the direction of where he believed, from certain signs, he
would come upon the deserted old lumber camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Although he had not mentioned the fact to his comrades,
Elmer was positive that he had smelled wood smoke in the
air; and as the gentle breeze happened to be blowing directly
in their faces, he knew from this that there must be some
kind of fire near by.</p>

<p>This had been the principal thing that caused him to
bring the expedition to a halt, while he skirmished ahead,
to see what lay there.</p>

<p>Inside of five minutes after quitting the company of his
fellow scouts, Elmer had his first glimpse of the old collection
of shanties known by the name of McGraw's Camp.</p>

<p>After that he became even more cautious in advancing
closer. Not that he fancied Dolph Gruber would be apt to
be very much on the alert; for he did not look upon the
man as versed to any extent in the ways of the woods, but
just on general principles.</p>

<p>He was within sixty feet of the largest building, which
had doubtless served as a lodging place for the dozen rough
loggers employed here long ago, during several winters,
when all at once Elmer froze in his tracks.</p>

<p>A man had come out of the building and proceeded toward
a fire that was smouldering close by. Fortunately
he did not happen to notice the boy, though Elmer saw him
sweep his eyes around in a careless way.</p>

<p>Although the boy had no acquaintance with Dolph
Gruber, he had heard the man described so often that he
knew immediately this could not be the same party. Gruber
was tall and rather thin, whereas this fellow was both
short and fat.</p>

<p>"A hobo, or a yeggman," was what flashed though the
mind of the lad, as he dropped flat behind some friendly
bushes where he could conceal himself, and at the same
time observe all that went on.</p>

<p>The fellow had all the ear-marks of a genuine tramp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Moreover, he looked ugly, as if he might prove a hard customer,
should he be assailed by the scouts.</p>

<p>"Getting breakfast," thought Elmer, as he noted how
the man started the fire up again; and then after it was
blazing cheerily began to put on a frying pan which must
contain some sort of meat.</p>

<p>"Hello! another of the same breed!" the boy whispered
to himself a short time later, as a second fellow shambled
from the long log cabin, and carrying in his hand some sort
of tomato can which might contain coffee.</p>

<p>"They keep late hours, all right," chuckled Elmer, noting
these preparations for a meal; "or else they're getting
this stuff ready for Dolph. That sounds more likely; and
it looks as if he knew these fellows were here when he
headed this way."</p>

<p>The presence of these two "Weary Willies" on the scene
promised to complicate things more than a little. Three
husky looking men instead of only one meant that the
scouts would have to be pretty smart if they hoped to outwit
the trio.</p>

<p>Still, Elmer had little fear of the result. He knew that
with a baker's dozen of good fellows at his back, he ought
to be able to come out ahead. But then, if his partly
formed plans came out decently there would be no need
of a rumpus, for the rescue of little Ruth might be effected
through strategy, just as he had told the warlike Matt
Tubbs.</p>

<p>Now and then he would glance toward the big cabin.
Doubtless Dolph and the girl were inside that; and he
wished he could find a way to creep up, so as to peep in
through one of the openings. If he were absolutely sure
that the two tramps would remain where they were, and
not come prowling around to the rear, Elmer might have
taken the chances of such a move.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was really no need. Whatever it was the men
were cooking over the fire, it seemed to take but a short
time; for the fat tramp presently waddled off to the door
of the cabin, thrust his head inside, and bawled out something.</p>

<p>And presently a man came out. He was leading a little
girl with golden hair, undoubtedly Ruth Tubbs. Elmer
saw immediately that she had been sobbing, for she put
her small hands to her face as if to rub away the tears.
And he gritted his teeth when he saw the man shake her
savagely, heard him growl some sort of a threat as to what
he would do if she didn't stop crying.</p>

<p>He made her sit down near the fire on a log. Then he
gave her something to eat on a piece of birch bark, which
one of the tramps had stripped, fresh and clean, from a
near-by tree.</p>

<p>At first the girl did not seem to want to eat, but upon
being threatened again by the brute, she made a pretense
of doing so, though it could be plainly seen that grief for
her mother was taking away any appetite she might have
had.</p>

<p>Elmer had seen enough from that side of the camp. If
he could only withdraw now, he wanted to move around so
as to come upon the place from the opposite side, and after
that he could shape his plans of action.</p>

<p>But was it safe to try and creep away while those three
fellows were so close to him? Should some movement on
his part attract the attention of either one of the ugly looking
tramps, who often looked that way, an investigation
would be next in order. And while Elmer did not much
doubt but that he could easily give them the slip, as he was
a good runner, his presence there, acting in such a suspicious
manner, would alarm the trio of tough characters, so
that they would be put on their guard and flee, or else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
shut themselves up in the log cabin and laugh at all the
puny efforts of the scouts to get at them.</p>

<p>So he was very cautious as he began to slowly push back.
Inch at a time he moved, save when very sure of his cover.
All the while he kept a vigilant watch over the parties in
the open spot.</p>

<p>Once Elmer's heart seemed to be almost in his mouth.
This was when the fatter one of the two suddenly craned
his neck in an attitude of scrutiny, as though he fancied he
had seen something moving off there in the underbrush.</p>

<p>Of course, if he made the first move as though bent on
an investigation, Elmer meant to spring boldly to his feet
and run for it, possibly in a direction away from the spot
where he had left his comrades.</p>

<p>But the man did not even get up from his seat. Judging
from his looks, Elmer decided that he must be a lazy
sort of fellow. And then again, why should the tramp entertain
the least suspicion that any human being could be
loitering around the old McGraw Camp, so far removed
from the railroad, and even the dirt roads leading to main
thoroughfares?</p>

<p>When things seemed all quiet again, Elmer continued his
wriggling movements, and presently arrived at a point
where he could make better progress, as the cover was
heavier.</p>

<p>At length he made a detour, approached the cabin again,
and scanned its immediate surroundings. Satisfied with
what he had learned, he proceeded to find the impatient
scouts, from whom he had been absent now almost an hour.</p>

<p>They were in a state of mind approaching insurrection.
Of course all manner of dreadful things were suggested
under their breath, as the boys huddled together. Every
slight sound made them start and look hurriedly around.
When a gray squirrel dropped a nut it seemed as though a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
gun had gone off; and later on when he himself frisked
around a neighboring tree butt in search of a further supply,
Landy Smith could hardly keep from crying out, his
nerves being all on edge with the strain.</p>

<p>Chatz had looked at his watch for the twentieth time,
and murmurs were beginning to rise all along the line,
when suddenly keen-eyed Mark exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I saw something move right then, fellows; there it is
again. It's Elmer, all right; and he looks as though he
might have discovered something of importance!"</p>

<p>"Bully! bully!" chuckled Ty Collins; "now we'll get
into action, I guess!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A REBELLION NIPPED IN THE BUD.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Did</span> you find 'em, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"What's the use asking such silly questions, when you
can see right now from the grin on his face that he did."</p>

<p>"Huh! don't you be so sure, Red Huggins; perhaps
he's laughing at the way the sun reflects on your hair!"</p>

<p>"Tell us what you saw, Elmer; we've passed an awful
hour," said Mark, sighing.</p>

<p>"Worst ever; thought it was five times as long!" complained
Toby.</p>

<p>They listened attentively as the returned scout related
his adventures while taking a survey of the old logging
camp at close quarters.</p>

<p>"Three of 'em&mdash;three husky tramps all in a bunch!
Say, that's going some, now, fellows!" remarked Ty.</p>

<p>"Ain't gettin' cold feet, I hope, so soon?" scoffed Red.</p>

<p>"When I do, you'll never know it, 'cause why&mdash;you'll be
about fifty miles away, scootin' for all you're worth toward
home, sweet home," declared Ty, aggressively.</p>

<p>"Yes, you see!" remarked Phil Dale, wagging his head
significantly.</p>

<p>"Now he's thinking of that popgun of his, Elmer, and
thinks you'll be sorry because you emptied all the cartridges
out," said Tom Cropsey.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm not bothering my head a bit over that," declared
the leader. "Fact is, I'd be afraid to have that
gun around if it was loaded. We're not going to need such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
things to capture these fellows. Perhaps there may be
plenty of other ways to scare them into giving up."</p>

<p>"But say, if it comes to a show-down, Elmer, you don't
mind if I just <i>point</i> my cannon at 'em, do you, and threaten
to blow the whole blooming lot into the next county if they
don't up with their little hands?" Phil asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," replied the other. "Make as much use of
an <i>empty</i> pistol as you want, but be sure the time is ripe.
Only as a last resort pull it on the men. And now, draw
in a little closer and we'll talk this thing over. Thirteen
heads ought to be some better than one."</p>

<p>Every one had a chance to make suggestions. Elmer invited
them to exchange views on the subject. He could
pick up a clever idea once in a while by this means, for
all boys do not think alike, and where he might overlook
something, one of the others would be sure to strike it.</p>

<p>"First of all, remember that we are not up here to capture
these tramps, though, of course, it may come to that
before we're through with the thing. To get possession
of little Ruth, that's our main idea," Elmer said more
than once.</p>

<p>"But even if we do, won't they follow after us, and try
to get the girl back again?" asked Red, who, it could
be plainly seen, was just spoiling for action.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will if they know where to look for us!"
replied the leader.</p>

<p>"Oh! I begin to see; you expect to blind the trail; or
send 'em off on a false scent! Ain't you the cute one,
though, Elmer? I take off my hat to you every time,"
chimed in "Lil Artha," who had been strangely quiet during
most of this discussion, though he was doing a heap of
thinking.</p>

<p>Matt Tubbs had listened to what Elmer had said. His
face had grown dark with one of his passionate uprisings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here," he broke out with at this point, "why
don't we just walk right into McGraw Camp, and up to that
coward, Dolph Gruber? What's the use knuckling down
in this way, I'd like to know? Thirteen of us ought to be
enough to turn them three old maids down right smart.
Let's just rush the place, and give 'em the lesson all kidnapers
ought to get! Who's with me?"</p>

<p>He looked straight at Red, first of all, as if aware of his
hasty temper. Indeed, that impulsive individual did make
a little move as though tempted to step over to the side of
Matt. Fighting had always come easy to Red in the old
days before he joined the scouts, and it was mighty hard
work conquering the spirit that had such a strong grip on
his nature.</p>

<p>Then some magnet caused him to twist to one side, and
send an appealing look toward Elmer, who shook his head
in the negative. Upon which Red fell back again with a
grunt. He had declined the plain invitation to rebel, which
the stranger in the camp had thrown at his feet.</p>

<p>No one else stirred. They even frowned, as though astonished
at the audacity of this one who had tried to raise
the standard of rebellion among the scouts.</p>

<p>"Huh! afraid to risk it, hey?" sneered Matt. "Don't
like the idea, of running up against a hard fist, is that it,
fellows? Say, is that the sort of milksops this here scout
business makes of boys? If it is, I reckon I ain't got much
use for it in mine."</p>

<p>"Hold on!"</p>

<p>It was Elmer who spoke just those two words, and the
bully of Fairfield turned to look in the face of the Wolf
Patrol leader. He stopped sneering, and even dropped his
eyes before the accusing ones of Elmer Chenowith.</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, Matt," said Elmer, quietly. "I
always thought you were a fellow of your word; that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
prided yourself on doing what you said you would. But
I see I'm mistaken. You promised me that if we allowed
you to come along you would obey orders. We scouts have
subscribed to the rules of an organization that makes
obedience to superior officers a thing of prime importance.
These fellows believe in me, trust in me. They know I will
not fail them purposely. And yet you have tried to get
them to rebel, and do something I've positively forbidden."</p>

<p>Matt looked very uneasy.</p>

<p>"I reckon I was away off, Elmer; excuse me," he muttered;
and that was more of an apology than any other boy
had even heard Matt Tubbs utter.</p>

<p>"All right; but you must learn to look at things in another
light," Elmer went on, severely. "Now, you know
that there are boys here who have been accustomed to rough-house
tactics almost as much as you yourself. A little
while ago it wouldn't have needed a second invitation to
coax Red, and Toby, and several others to trot along at
your heels, and pitch into those tramps like hot cakes. But
they have turned over a new leaf. Not that they can't
fight, and fight hard, if necessary; but they are no longer
looking for trouble."</p>

<p>Matt scratched his head, and tried to appear as though
he understood; but it was slow to penetrate his brain; all
his life he had written only on one side of the slate; in fact,
until lately he did not know there was another side.</p>

<p>"Obedience is a true scout's glory," Elmer continued,
with a purpose in view. "That man is best fitted to command
who has learned to obey. So you see, although
tempted to join you, not a single one of the boys did so.
I do not think you will ever look at things the same way
again, or try to create a rebellion in camp where you have
been received only on probation."</p>

<p>"That's right; I knows it, Elmer. I was dead wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
And I'm goin' to do just whatever you say," declared
Matt, looking grimly around, as though challenging any
boy to dare throw up to him the fact that in doing this he
must be showing signs of weakness.</p>

<p>"Then we'll forget all about the incident. Now, let's
get back to where we were, and see if we can hit on some
plan to get little Ruth away." Elmer went on as pleasantly
as though nothing had occurred to ruffle his temper.</p>

<p>"I was wondering," said Chatz, "if given a little time,
they mightn't do all the capturing themselves, suh."</p>

<p>"How is that, Chatz?" demanded Toby; "I know my
skull is thick, but somehow I just don't seem to grab that
idea on the jump."</p>

<p>"Yes, explain what you've got in mind, please," remarked
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Well, I remembered that when you were telling all
you had seen, suh, that you said the fat tramp and the tall
thin one were taking a swig every few minutes out of a
couple of big whisky flasks they carried in their pockets,
and which you guessed Dolph must have fetched along
for them."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, now I begin to see," remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Supposing now, suh, they are allowed to drain those
same flasks, do you believe they would be knocked out;
and if we entered the camp it would be to find both of them
fast asleep, and dead to the world?"</p>

<p>"That's an idea worth considering," Elmer declared.
"But we shouldn't depend entirely upon it."</p>

<p>"If there was only some way of getting those two men
away from the camp it would make it easy sailing for us,"
suggested Mark.</p>

<p>"They act as though they expected to stay around here
for some time," Elmer answered. "In fact, from a few
words I happened to hear them let fall, I wouldn't be surprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
if they had done something or other that made them
afraid that the police might be having an eye out for two
fellows of their description. And that's the main reason
they are sticking so close to this lonesome lumber camp."</p>

<p>"Suppose you outline your scheme, Elmer," Red said,
humbly; "we'll fall in line, and endorse it, no matter
what it is."</p>

<p>"Well, it's getting on toward the middle of the day right
now, and since some of us had our breakfasts right early,
suppose we take a snack before tackling this job," Matty
suggested.</p>

<p>When the question of eating comes up among a party of
hungry boys it is certain to take precedence, just as a
motion to adjourn is said to be always in order.</p>

<p>"That gets me where I live," declared Red, nodding his
head vigorously.</p>

<p>"All in favor hold up your right hands," said the acting
scout-master; and immediately eleven hands shot into
the air.</p>

<p>Every one present had voted in favor of the motion save
the leader and Matt Tubbs. And even the latter looked
happier than before, when, taking a good sized roll from
his haversack, Elmer divided it in half and offered one portion
to the uninvited guest.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it was the part of wisdom for the
scouts to partake of lunch before entering upon any more
strenuous work. Boys never feel quite so venturesome on
an empty as a full stomach. At least, after the long hike,
they needed refreshments, every one thought.</p>

<p>"Look at Ted, will you; he's the disappointed one,"
whispered Mark in the ear of the scout master.</p>

<p>Indeed, Ted did continue to frown as if he had met with
a severe loss; and yet as a rule he had never been known
as a fighter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you see what it is," answered Elmer, amused.
"He was just beginning to believe there would be a rumpus
and lots of bruises to be taken care of. Ted is getting
more and more earnest in his liking for the profession
of a surgeon."</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted Toby, who chanced to be standing
close enough to hear what passed between the two chums;
"he's getting more and more cracked, that's what. Unless
he curls that disposition of his, I'm afraid he'll get bounced
from the scouts before long."</p>

<p>"Why, what's his desire to be a doctor and a surgeon
got to do with it?" asked Mark, curiously.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm getting afraid of that fellow, for a fact.
He just keeps thinking of those old operations he's been
reading about, all the blessed time. Plague take it, fellows,
I'm suspecting that unless Ted finds a subject to work on
when the fit takes him, he'll <i>make</i> one! Anyhow, I'm going
to be mighty careful how I let myself go out alone with
him after dark."</p>

<p>Elmer and Mark looked at Toby to see if he might not be
joking, but if so, he certainly managed to keep a straight
face through it all.</p>

<p>"Oh! I guess there isn't any danger of that," said the
patrol leader, soothingly; "and all of us have to admit that
Ted certainly knows his business very well. He can dress
a wound splendidly, and I'd be willing to trust him to set
my arm if ever I was unlucky enough to get it broken.
Don't worry about Ted, Toby; he's all to the good, and I
suspect that pretty much all of that ferocious spirit is put
on for effect. He can be as gentle as a woman when he's
dressing a wound, for I've watched him."</p>

<p>As all the scouts were now through "feeding," as some
of them called the process of eating their "snacks" carried
along for the purpose, the plan of campaign proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
by Elmer was gone over carefully, so that every fellow
might be sure he understood the part he was expected to
play in the round-up.</p>

<p>"All ready, suh!" announced Chatz Maxfield, finally.</p>

<p>"Then we'll begin to advance, and this time we will do
without the bugle, Mark. Remember your patrol calls,
and keep your ears open for my signal. The whistle might
arouse suspicions here, so I'll give the harsh cry of the bluejay
three times. Then act! Now, be off, all of you; and
Matt, you come with me!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RED PLAYS THE PART OF THE CRAFTY FOX.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the acting scout-master thus asked the recognized
bully of Fairfield to accompany him, he had several good
reasons for the step, strange as it might seem to Mark and
the others, who fancied that possibly Matt should be posted
at some distance where he was likely to do no harm.</p>

<p>But Elmer preferred to have him under his own eye.
Moreover, the scheme upon which he was embarked was
tinged with more or less danger; and Matt was a husky
chap, capable of giving a good account of himself.</p>

<p>But then Matt Tubbs was not the only one who accompanied
the leader. Elmer had chosen to take with him
Ted, Lil Artha, Toby, Mark, Landy and Tom Cropsey.
This left five others, and they were also divided into two
detachments, one consisting of Matty, Phil, Chatz, Ty;
while Red Huggins made up the other all by himself.</p>

<p>As to the plan of campaign, it might be well to explain
what Elmer had fashioned in his mind, as justifying their
efforts.</p>

<p>He had noticed, when spying around the further end of
the long log cabin, an odd tunnel underneath the walls.
This, no doubt, had been made by some woodchuck or other
animal, desirous of finding a snug winter home.</p>

<p>Elmer fully believed that the passage was amply large
enough to allow a boy to crawl through. And as it was
apparently situated at that end of the building least likely
to be used by the tramps, he expected that he and his mates
would be able to creep in without being discovered.</p>

<p>Supposing his expectations were fulfilled; then the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
detachment was to hide as near the door of the cabin as
they could. Finally, Red, at some little distance, was to
play his part in the game.</p>

<p>Red had always been known as a most adroit "fox" in
the games the lads of Hickory Ridge played. Once he
started out to elude those hounds set upon his track, none
had ever been successful in overtaking him. His methods
of dodging and doubling on his track were famous throughout
all the region, and in selecting him for the part of fox
Elmer knew just what to expect.</p>

<p>Red was to "toll" the tramps out of the cabin and lose
them somewhere in the depths of the woods. Meanwhile,
with perhaps a clear field before them, Elmer and his scouts
could easily accomplish the balance of the affair.</p>

<p>Of course there was always the question as to whether
it would work.</p>

<p>Following the lead of the scout master, the little squad of
boys slipped around so as to come upon the long cabin
from the rear. Everything seemed peaceful. No one was
in sight, the men having apparently stepped inside again
after Dolph and little Ruth had been fed.</p>

<p>This was as it should be, and Elmer had indeed figured
on it when laying his plans. In single file they approached
as near as was deemed safe; then, at a signal from the
leader, the scouts dropped flat behind some bushes. From
this point on, their progress must be much slower, since they
would have to do considerable crawling.</p>

<p>Before making a move, however, Elmer gave the signal
that was to start the other detachments. This, as agreed
on, consisted of the harsh cry of the bluejay, and which in
the still air of the woods could be easily heard for a long
distance.</p>

<p>After that things were to happen in regulation order.
Elmer had calculated just how long it might take his band<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to obtain entrance to the cabin; also for the other detachment
to find a hiding place near by. Red was scheduled to
commence operations just half an hour after he heard the
bluejay cry three times. And to make sure, he carried
the nickel watch of Chatz with him.</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows, and be careful, every one," was the
low whisper which Elmer allowed to float back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Having been over the ground once before, and with his
customary sagacity memorized every little point that could
be used to advantage, Elmer was not in the least dismayed
at certain obstacles that from time to time had to be surmounted.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the signal had been given he led his
line of creeping scouts up to the further end of the long,
low cabin. And so far as they knew no hostile eye had
taken note of their coming.</p>

<p>The tunnel was close at hand. Its smooth walls told
of the many times the animal responsible for its presence
had crept in and out. And Elmer noted with considerable
satisfaction that his former conception of its capacity had
not been amiss. Yes, even the stoutest of the scouts could
pass through, with a little assistance.</p>

<p>Even here the shrewdness of the young scout-master
showed itself. He had arranged his schedule so that this
individual, who chanced to be Landy, always known as a
fat youth, though fond of all outdoor sports, should come
last. This, it may be noted in passing, was done so that in
case he did stick in the tunnel he might not block the passage
of others whose presence was vital to the success of
the plan.</p>

<p>Elmer never forgot anything he heard or read, and it
happened that not so very long before he had been interested
in an account of the escape from Libby Prison of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
large number of Union prisoners during the dark days of
the Civil War, and vividly remembered how there might
have been many more follow the same route only that an
ambitious fat man closed the passage, since he could neither
go on nor return.</p>

<p>Of course it was the intention of the scout-master himself
to lead the way. He could not think of delegating that
important function to any one else. And Lil Artha was to
follow at his heels, to be succeeded by others, Matt Tubbs
coming just before Landy, on account of his size.</p>

<p>Lying on his back, Elmer started in head first. This he
did because the tunnel performed a quick curve upward,
after once passing under the lower log; and as most boys
are not as supple as gymnasts and contortionists, and cannot
bend backward the same as forward, he knew this was
the only way of passing through.</p>

<p>Using his heels to help propel his body forward, and being
gently assisted by little pushes from his mates, Elmer
readily went through the ceremony of imitating the woodchuck
that had used the hole during the past winter.</p>

<p>As he raised his head above the level of the earthen floor
he took a quick observation. The boys outside gave an inclination
of continuing the pushing movement, so that it
became necessary for him to kick in a way they would
understand meant a temporary halt.</p>

<p>It was not very light inside the long cabin, because there
were only a few openings that had served as windows, and
even some of these had become clogged with stray rubbish
in the years that elapsed since the logging camp knew life
and bustle.</p>

<p>After a brief interval, however, Elmer was able to see
fairly well. Just as he had anticipated, those who now
occupied the place were down near the door at the other
end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>First of all he made out that the three men and one little
girl comprised the entire list of occupants. This pleased
him, because as yet he had not been positive on this point;
and if it proved that there were half a dozen tough characters
assembled under the roof of the log bunk-cabin,
the work which the scouts had laid out for themselves must
have been considerably extended.</p>

<p>Ruth was by herself. She had eaten at the command
of her stepfather, but not with any heart in the matter,
and now she was huddled in a little bunch, possibly crying
under her breath, for she did not dare do anything more
to anger the man she feared.</p>

<p>The three men were sprawled out in some of the old
bunks. A bundle of dried grass made a fair mattress for
fellows unused to anything better, and they seemed quite
satisfied with their surroundings.</p>

<p>Elmer knew that he must not linger too long. Behind
him were seven impatient fellows, all anxious to do that
great crawling stunt. So he once more got in motion and
wriggled himself into the cabin.</p>

<p>Luckily the tall, thin tramp whom Elmer mentally called
Skinny, even as Fatty covered the stout, happy-go-lucky
chap, had a voice like a fog-horn; and a laugh that was as
raspy as a file; so that when he got going there was little
chance of any slight sound from the end of the long cabin
being noticed.</p>

<p>And as the squirrels ran haphazard all over the roof of
the building, any such sound would of necessity be attributed
to them, for such a thing as a hostile force penetrating
this far into the timber would never strike any of
the men as possible.</p>

<p>A touch on the arm presently warned Elmer that the first
of his followers had wormed his way through that crooked
passage. Trust the angular Lil Artha for being able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
navigate a zigzag tunnel with greatest ease. No doubt he
slipped in and out with almost the handiness with which
one might crack a whip.</p>

<p>Then came Toby, Mark and Tom. After that there was
a slight hitch, as though perhaps Matt Tubbs might be having
a little difficulty; but they could hear faint scratching
sounds from the tunnel that proved he was coming along.
As for Landy, it did not matter materially whether he arrived
or not, so long as he did nothing to alarm the enemy.</p>

<p>Everything was apparently working just as Elmer, like
a wise general, had figured on. The three men still continued
to talk and argue, being worked up over some sort
of proposition that Dolph seemed to be putting before the
others.</p>

<p>Several words that came to the ears of Elmer from time
to time convinced him that Dolph Gruber was fully as bad
a man as he had suspected, for there could be no doubt but
that he was now actually planning to lead his reckless companions
on a raid of some sort, looking to robbery as a
reward of their enterprise.</p>

<p>It must be getting on toward the time appointed when
Red was expected to take up his part of the game.</p>

<p>Landy had not yet arrived, but he was heroically endeavoring
to join his comrades. Indeed, during a temporary
lull in the conversation of the trio of men at the other end
of the cabin, Elmer could hear a gasping sound from the
tunnel that alarmed him not a little, lest it attract the
attention of the plotters, and lead to a search calculated to
upset all their well-laid plans.</p>

<p>So he immediately pushed down into the mouth of the
tunnel, and groping around until he came in contact with
the clawing hands of the stout boy, began to gently but
firmly drag him through.</p>

<p>It was a tight fit, but luckily Landy made it, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
only for the assistance Elmer gave him he must have stuck
there ingloriously until the end of the affair, and thus been
unable to assume his proper share in the rescue of little
Ruth.</p>

<p>All were now on hand, Landy panting in a way that
made Lil Artha dig his elbow into his ribs as a warning
that he was making altogether too much noise.</p>

<p>"Why don't Red start his bazoo?" whispered that long-legged
worthy in Elmer's ear, as he lay flattened out on
the ground in the gloomy far-end part of the loggers' bunk-house.</p>

<p>"Never fear, you can count on Red to do his part," was
what the scout master managed to convey in the same sort of
careful whisper; and fearful lest Arthur, who was known
to be rather talkative, get fairly started, when it was most
unwise to indulge in any conversation with those enemies
so close by, Elmer gave a gentle "'sh!" to signify that
silence just then was golden.</p>

<p>The impatient ones were counting the seconds, and wondering
how they could ever hold out much longer. Elmer
kept watching the three men, knowing that through their
actions at least he could readily tell when the expected
break had come.</p>

<p>Ruth still had her face hidden in her dress, and was
doubtless filled with grief because of this cruel enforced
separation from her own mother.</p>

<p>And as he thus waited, his heart beating faster than its
wont, Elmer caught a faint cry. It came from some distance
off, and seemed to be filled with the utmost distress.</p>

<p>"Help! oh! help!"</p>

<p>The time limit having expired, that was Red getting in
his work as the crafty fox attempting to coax the hounds
on a false scent.</p>

<p>The three men had started up. They were looking at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
each other, as though hardly knowing what to make of it.
To hear a call for assistance in this lonely vicinity was certainly
enough to bewilder, yes, and perhaps to alarm anyone;
especially men whose past had been so very shady
that they suspected everything which they could not fully
understand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TAKEN BY SURPRISE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hey!</span> what's that?"</p>

<p>The tall, thin tramp had jumped up from the bunk as
he cried out in this fashion. His fat companion was also
hastily scrambling out of his comfortable lodgings. Both
of them looked alarmed, but Elmer noted with more or less
satisfaction that the very one who might have been expected
to be anxious showed the least sign of consternation. Indeed,
a crafty look had come over Dolph's face, as though
something pleasant might have struck him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" demanded Dolph, who,
while he deserted his bunk, did so in a leisurely manner,
as if to show his indifference.</p>

<p>"Didn't yuh hear that yell?" exclaimed the lean hobo.</p>

<p>"Sure I did; think I ain't got ears?" replied Dolph,
sneeringly. "But what ails the two of ye? Look like ye
wanted to skip out, and make tracks."</p>

<p>"But who'd be comin' away up here, 'cept they wanted
tuh git us? Sense that leetle job over in Janesville a month
back, me an' Pete don't feel jest as safe as we'd like!"
went on the thin tramp.</p>

<p>"Aw! go chase yourself, Simsy," scoffed Dolph. "Listen
again, would ye? D'ye mark what the cove's ayellin'?
He sez he wants help as plain as can be. D'ye think if
they was any cop around they'd be tellin' us about it?
Wouldn't they rather creep up on us sly like, and nail us
before we could run? Rats! jest use yer brains and figger
it out!"</p>

<p>"But what is it, then?" demanded the fellow called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Simsy; "if so be yuh know, tell us, Dolph? I ain't no
coward, but I ain't no fool neither. An' if it comes tuh
hangin' around, an' lettin' these jay cops git a strangle
hold on me jest tuh show my grit, I tell yuh I ain't in it."</p>

<p>"Say, don't ye know the old loggin' road leads up here
from the main line? I heard afore now o' fellers in cars
mistakin' the way, or thinkin' they could cut off a heap
of distance by startin' in on the side. All right, then; a
fool is born every second, they say; an' one of 'em has
just gone and got into trouble tryin' to foller that old
loggin' road."</p>

<p>The tall tramp looked at his fat companion; and then
both turned their eyes on Dolph as he finished speaking.
Apparently his logic struck them as sound, for the expression
of fear had already begun to vanish from their
unwashed faces.</p>

<p>"D'ye really an' truly reckon that's what it be,
Dolph?" asked the hobo who had answered to the name of
Pete.</p>

<p>"'Cause we don't wanter take any chances, yuh see,"
added the tall one, shaking his little head to add emphasis
to his remark.</p>

<p>"'Course it is," affirmed Dolph, with a laugh of scorn
that did more to convince his mates than all his talking.
"I tell ye that's some fool feller in a car. He's run into
a tree, or some fool play like that, an' p'raps got hurted
bad. Looky here, you two, how d'ye know this ain't jest
the luckiest thing for us three coves that ever came down
the pike?"</p>

<p>"What way?" growled Simsy.</p>

<p>"Yes, speak up an' tell us, Dolph," echoed the other.
"Allers sed as how yuh had the brains o' the bunch. Me
an' Pete likes the red licker too much. Right now we ain't
all we orter be. How's it goin' tuh be lucky for us three?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," continued Dolph, with vehemence, "don't ye
see, if so be this happens to be a rich guy what has got
hurted, we can tote him in here, an' keep him along till
he coughs up a nice little pile to his life savers. And if
ye know a good thing when ye run across it, why both o'
ye ought to put out to find him, and bring him back as
quick as ye can."</p>

<p>At that Pete and Simsy again exchanged looks. The
love of gain was rapidly overcoming their first fears; just
as the artful Dolph had known it would.</p>

<p>"How 'bout you, ole feller; don't you jine us in this
game?" asked the thin tramp, a little suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Sure I do," returned Dolph, with ready assurance;
"but there ain't no need of the whole three of us goin' out
to carry one feller here. 'Sides, you remember I got a
mighty sore heel after my long walk."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;yuh ain't agoin' tuh clear out an' leave us?"
questioned the tall hobo.</p>

<p>"Well, what sort of crazy questions are ye askin'? I'll
stay right here, an' wait for ye to fetch the feller back.
Then leave it to me to work him for the stuff. I'm some
good at that sort o' thing, I reckon," and Dolph grinned
in their faces.</p>

<p>"So yuh are, Dolph, so yuh are," replied Simsy.
"What say, Pete, do we start out to do the great rescuin'
act, and bring the poor bubble wagon fool here to get
bleeded?"</p>

<p>"Ho! I'm willin' if yuh say so, Simsy," replied the fat
tramp, promptly, the prospect of gain acting as a lure in
his eyes that outweighed all other considerations.</p>

<p>Elmer had listened to all this with the utmost eagerness.
One minute he fancied that the lovely little trap he had
baited so cleverly was about to work; and then again he
found himself beset with fears that it had been all for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
naught; and that if the alarmed tramps made up their
minds to flee, Dolph would decide to accompany them,
which in turn meant that little Ruth must be spirited away,
and another long chase follow.</p>

<p>But, after all, it seemed now that things were moving
along nicely. Dolph could be thanked for greasing the
ways, though of course the fellow never dreamed how he
was riding to a fall in doing so.</p>

<p>"Come along then, Pete; we'll take a look in at thet
squaller, an' see how bad he's hurted."</p>

<p>The tall tramp made for the near-by door of the log
cabin while speaking, and his fat mate trotted at his heels,
for all the world like a little dog&mdash;but an ugly bulldog at
that, for he had the face of a ruffian, did Pete.</p>

<p>Thus they passed out, stopping at the door to listen once
more, while Dolph urged them to lose no further time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Red had been duly busy. Every minute the
sound of his voice, filled with wild entreaty, came on the
breeze.</p>

<p>"Help! oh! won't somebody come and help me! This
way! Oh! what a terrible fix I'm in! Help! help!" he
would shout in the most dismal tone imaginable.</p>

<p>Of course Red was so situated that he could see the door
of the cabin from a distance. Thus he would know when
anyone sallied forth to try and rescue the one supposed
to be in a peck of trouble. And once that occurred, the
crafty "fox" was due to exercise his wonderful ingenuity
by slipping away, and later on lifting up his wail for assistance
in a new quarter.</p>

<p>Thus he would coax the two tramps hither and thither,
arousing their hopes only to dash them to the ground by
a new appeal from another section. In the end, of course,
such fellows would begin to believe they were being hoodwinked&mdash;that
there must be something uncanny about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mysterious calls, and they would be seized with a small
panic that must wind up the hunting game.</p>

<p>But meanwhile ten, perhaps fifteen, minutes might have
elapsed; and surely that space of time would be enough
for Elmer and his fellow scouts to accomplish the end they
had in view.</p>

<p>The young scout leader always did his work with more
or less system. He had decided that they ought to let at
least three minutes elapse after the departure of the men,
before attempting any move. This would take them far
enough away from the bunk-house so that any ordinary
outcry from within would hardly reach their ears. Having
no other way of determining upon the passage of time,
Elmer began to count under his breath as soon as the bulky
figure of Pete had vanished from the open door of the
building.</p>

<p>Three minutes does not seem a long time under ordinary
conditions; indeed, in many instances it just slips past like
magic. And yet try counting the seconds contained within
that short space of time&mdash;one hundred and eighty of them,
all told&mdash;why, it seems enormous. But steadily Elmer was
putting them over, determined not to change his plans,
and give way to his natural impatience, since he had in
the beginning figured on that three-minute leeway.</p>

<p>He could feel the uneasy movements of his impatient
chums. Lil Artha even went so far as to nudge him in
the ribs, as though he had begun to suspect that their
cautious leader might have gone to sleep. But Elmer gave
back an answering dig that convinced the other of his being
on the alert.</p>

<p>When he had finally reached the end of the probation,
Elmer himself began to make a forward movement. All
the while he counted those passing seconds he had been
closely watching the figure of Dolph, so as to be ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for action. That was the motto of the scouts, "Be prepared,"
and he certainly believed in living up to it.</p>

<p>Dolph had come back into the cabin. He appeared to be
listening from time to time, as though a little anxious himself
concerning the nature of that strange call for assistance;
for all he had pretended to treat it so lightly when
his allies were present.</p>

<p>Dolph had dropped down upon a block of wood, and was
examining something which he had taken from his pocket.
Elmer was not able to get a good look at this article, but,
knowing the desperate character of the man who sat there,
and how he had now burned his bridges behind him when
he kidnaped the child of the woman he had married and
tortured, the boy could easily guess its nature.</p>

<p>It was what Lil Artha would call a "gun," otherwise
a revolver of the bulldog type, dangerous enough in the
hands of a reckless scoundrel who feared arrest.</p>

<p>Elmer was conscious of a new little thrill, but he mentally
scorned the thought of this being any indication of
fear. Indeed, to thoroughly disprove such a silly thing
he even increased the pace with which he was creeping
across the earthen floor of the cabin.</p>

<p>Dolph still sat there, his head bent low over the tool he
was fondling, as he listened for any change in the cries
from outside. If he would only kindly continue to hold
that attitude for another full minute, Elmer believed he
might be in a position to make an aggressive move.</p>

<p>Just then the scout leader became aware of something
that gave him a momentary spasm of acute alarm. Ruth
no longer had her face buried in her dress. Something
had caused her to stop her silent weeping, and look up.
Perhaps she, too, had been attracted by those wails for
help which the Boy Scout fox was using as a means for
"tolling" the two dangerous tramps away from the cabin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>But in raising her head Ruth had been made aware of
some strange movement back of the bent-over figure of her
stepfather. She was now staring with round-eyed wonder
at the string of crawling figures that extended from the
rear wall of the cabin.</p>

<p>Elmer raised his hand, and held up a warning finger.
He hoped by this means to convince the girl that they
were friends, and nothing was to be feared. But he also
hoped that Matt Tubbs, whom he knew to be close at his
side, might be doing something of the same kind; and that
little Ruth would recognize her cousin.</p>

<p>Whether the child could have given utterance to some
low bubbling cry of fear or joy, which reached the ears
of the man, or he just happened to look up, and noticed
how she was staring past him, no one ever knew.</p>

<p>Elmer became suddenly aware that Dolph had whirled
around on his stool, and was looking in sheer amazement
at the peculiar spectacle of eight figures worming their
way across the earthen floor of the bunk-house and headed
straight for the spot where he himself was seated.</p>

<p>He certainly could not mistake the danger that accompanied
the presence of all these strangers. And, given
just three seconds in which to collect his wits, the desperate
fugitive and kidnaper would of course do something looking
toward one thing or the other&mdash;flight or resistance.</p>

<p>Elmer did not mean to allow of either. He had been
nerving himself for just this crisis, and his muscles were
ready primed for a quick leap.</p>

<p>But, prepared as he was for the action that meant so
much toward the carrying out of his plans, there was
one ahead of Elmer. This was Matt Tubbs, who, crouching
there like a tiger beside the leader of the Wolf Patrol,
had reached the limit of his endurance and submission to
orders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Even as Elmer started to throw himself forward, meaning
to clasp his arms about the man before he could rise,
or do any damage with his weapon, a figure shot past him.
Then he saw Matt Tubbs hurl himself bodily upon Dolph
Gruber. At the same time the pistol fell to the ground,
struck on a stone, and was discharged!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ELMER THINKS IT PAYS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> a scene of wild confusion as followed.</p>

<p>Six other eager lads besides Elmer and Matt Tubbs
strove to get a chance to have "a finger in the pie," as Lil
Artha called it. They even pushed among themselves, in
their eagerness to land somewhere upon the squirming
figure of the struggling victim.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Four other fellows had been hiding
without, screened by some friendly bushes from the sight
of Pete and Simsy when they issued forth in search of
the unfortunate who was so beseechingly calling for help.
These chaps, hearing the beginning of the racket within
the bunk-house, looked upon it as a signal for their advance.</p>

<p>Through the open door they came in a confused bunch,
ready to lend any assistance in their power. But just at
that moment it looked as if there were already quite enough
hands clustering around the astonished and disgusted Dolph
Gruber to attend to his case. And as Lil Artha said, "Too
many cooks sometimes spoil the broth."</p>

<p>Dolph possibly as yet did not understand what it all
meant. He had had a glimpse of khaki uniforms, and may
have suspected that the authorities had summoned a company
of the militia from some neighboring city to search
for the kidnaper and the missing child.</p>

<p>He struggled desperately; but when some six or eight
pretty husky boys hurl their united weight on one person
that individual has a slim chance of throwing off the burden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
And so Dolph had to take it out in wriggling and
grunting.</p>

<p>Lil Artha had made preparations looking to this condition
of affairs. Indeed, had he been a duly elected sheriff
of the county he could hardly have been more in readiness
to secure a prisoner.</p>

<p>"Hold him steady, fellows, while I tie his hands behind
his back!" he exclaimed; "there, turn him over a little
more; and Matt, twist that left arm further back. That's
the ticket, boys. Watch me fix him up in a jiffy, will
you?"</p>

<p>He started to wrap some stout twine around and around
the wrists of the prisoner. By this time Dolph seemed to
become aware of the fact that these mysterious fellows, who
had crept in through some back entrance, and pounced
upon him with such scant ceremony, were a pack of half-grown
boys. He started to roar threats at them, filled with
rage at the thought of such an indignity as being so rudely
handled by mere lads. But despite his worst efforts he
could not break loose from the grip they had upon his
person.</p>

<p>"Whoop! that's the way to do it, fellows!" Lil Artha
continued to declare, as he completed his job. "Talk to
me about your football tackle, this takes the cake, sure!
Now for another little splice around his legs. Sit on him,
some of you! No matter if he does object; what right has
a kidnaper got we're bound to respect? Let him bawl
till he gets hoarse. We've got him, and we're going to hold
him till he's shut up in the cooler at Hickory Ridge!"</p>

<p>Elmer meanwhile had not forgotten that Dolph had
comrades. Doubtless his angry shouts must have reached
the ears of the two tramps, who could not have gotten entirely
beyond range of a loud voice.</p>

<p>"Here, you fellows," he called to the four boys who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
had come darting through the entrance of the cabin, "shut
that door, and find some way to barricade it! We may
have the other men attacking us yet; and you remember
how we arranged our plans in case that happens. Quick,
let's get ready for a siege!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! that's the ticket!" cried Chatz Maxfield.
"Lend a hand here, fellows, and we'll do the thing up
in style. Yes, suh, we-all have armed ourselves with the
nicest clubs you evah saw, and hope to find a chance to use
them, dusting the garments of those two hoboes."</p>

<p>Every one of the quartette, besides Elmer himself, became
as busy as the proverbial bee. The door was swung
shut, even though it required more or less muscular persuasion
to bring about this result, because of long disuse.
Then every description of weighty article upon which they
could lay hands was hastily piled up against the said door,
until almost in a minute it was barricaded so sturdily
that a battering ram would be needed in order to smash
it in.</p>

<p>"Don't stop there!" cried Elmer. "The hole at the
end of the place must be filled up and guarded. Then a
couple of fellows must stand at each of these open windows,
ready to give those tramps a warm reception if they try
to force their company on us."</p>

<p>"Let some of the rest of us have a chance to help!"
called Lil Artha, as he scrambled to his feet. "Oh! don't
bother about Dolph; he's laced up as tight as any old yellow
pigskin ball could be at the beginning of a game on
the gridiron. This way, Toby, Mark, and Landy&mdash;bring
some of those blocks along. Everybody get busy, and prepare
to resist boarders. Reckon these are a different kind
of boarders than the ones that used to eat their grub here
winters. Whoop! we can do it, and not half try!"</p>

<p>Elmer believed that he had by this time managed to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
things in as decent shape as lay within his power. Supposing
the shouts had reached the ears of those two
tramps&mdash;would they dare turn back and make for the
cabin at their best speed?</p>

<p>He thought not. What he had seen and heard concerning
both Pete and the tall hobo caused him to suspect that
their first thought would be in connection with their own
safety. They had shown this before when desirous of running,
and only giving heed to Dolph's suggestion that there
might be some pecuniary profit for them in trying to find
the unfortunate who called for assistance.</p>

<p>And now, after being "tolled" from place to place by
that strange voice, until their suspicions were once more
aroused, should they hear the dreadful clamor accompanying
the capture of their companion, the possibility of their
taking chances in making a bolt back to the bunk-house
were small indeed.</p>

<p>Elmer was more inclined to believe that both tramps
must be in full flight at that very moment.</p>

<p>But he had looked ahead for even the worst that could
happen. Red Huggins had his orders. Should the two
men return to the camp, and attempt to break in, bent on
doing the boys serious hurt, his was to be the duty of
seeking help&mdash;of managing to reach some town, and bringing
the officers to the old logging camp.</p>

<p>"The tunnel is filled up, Elmer; even a rat couldn't
crawl through that hole right now!" reported Mark, presently.</p>

<p>Elmer was looking out through one of the small openings.
If he felt any anxiety concerning the possible coming
of the two tramps his face failed to show it as he
turned upon his best chum, saying:</p>

<p>"Are all the windows guarded, and do the boys understand
what they are to do if anybody tries to get in?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I should smile," laughed Mark, a little hysterically,
for he was filled with the excitement of the occasion.
"Just let one of those rascals try to poke his nose
in here, and he's going to meet up with the surprise of his
life. Look at Lil Artha taking a fresh grip on that long
wagon-tongue of his; I bet you he's just trying to imagine
himself at bat, with two out, two men on bases, and a
couple of runs needed to tie the score. Yes, siree, he
means to send the ball out of the lot for a homer, and
don't you forget it. Oh! don't I pity Pete if ever he
comes tapping at that window with Lil Artha standing
guard."</p>

<p>"I don't see or hear anything of the men, which looks
good," remarked Elmer, as he once more turned to glance
outside, to where the trees and the scrub adjoining the deserted
lumber camp could be observed.</p>

<p>"But say, Elmer, didn't you tell Red something about
letting us know what the men were doing? Wasn't he to
send a signal of some sort?" Mark went on.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," replied the young scout leader of the
Wolf Patrol; "but then, perhaps he hasn't been able to
make sure yet. You see, he had to keep skipping around
pretty lively in order to give them the slip. But all the
same, I reckon it's about time we heard something from
Red."</p>

<p>"Hark!"</p>

<p>Even as Mark uttered this one word, there came floating
to their ears from some little distance away a strange
sound. One who was unacquainted with the woods might
have believed that it was an odd mixture between a dog
howling and a baby squalling.</p>

<p>Elmer chuckled as if amused.</p>

<p>"Red hasn't got it down quite pat yet," he remarked,
"but then, he wants practice. I've heard coyotes and big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gray wolves howl lots of times, but that's a new one on
me. Still, Red means well, and what he signals tells us
the two men have lit out for all they're worth."</p>

<p>"Bully!" cried Lil Artha, who heard what Elmer had
said. "We hold the fort, and the enemy has skipped out!
Now, I opine that I'm some disappointed, because I did
hope to try that nice club; but it's all right. I'm a peaceful
chap, when I can have my own way. And we've got
what we came for, fellows. Here, let's give a big three
cheers for the Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>They were given with a vim and a volume of sound that
must have been heard fully a mile away. Doubtless it
quickened the pace of the fleeing tramps, who might
suspect that they were being hunted by a whole regiment
of citizens, stirred to indignation by the stealing of little
Ruth.</p>

<p>This made Elmer suddenly remember the girl. She had
been watching the actions of the scouts, at first with wonder
and awe, but by degrees even smiling. Perhaps the
fact that they had made a prisoner of her tormentor, Dolph
Gruber, may have had more or less influence along this
line. Then again, she had of course seen Matt Tubbs by
now, and knew the newcomers must be friends.</p>

<p>Elmer stepped over to the child. The smile on his face
was enough to convince little Ruth that, with the coming
of these boys in their drab-colored suits, her troubles were
ended; and if she were possessed of any lurking doubts
they must have taken flight with the first words he spoke.</p>

<p>"We've come to take you back to your mother, Ruth, and
I hope you won't be afraid of us. Here's your Cousin
Matt along, too; you know him, don't you? It's all right
now, Ruth; nobody can hurt you while the Boy Scouts
are here," was the way Elmer spoke; and when he held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
out his hand the child readily put her own little quivering
one within it, showing her utter confidence.</p>

<p>Then Matt Tubbs came up, his face wreathed in smiles.
Matt was tickled to realize that he had been along when
the rescue of the kidnaped child had been effected. More
than this, Matt had seen a lot of things that would give
him occasion for much serious thought later on&mdash;things
that must have a bearing on his whole future. He had
been given a practical object lesson concerning the other
side of life, the decent side, which, up to now, had been
pretty much of a sealed book to this pronounced bully of
Fairfield.</p>

<p>Elmer, looking at the gentle way Matt was fondling the
little girl, nodded his head and seemed well pleased.</p>

<p>"I guess I didn't make any mistake when I said there
was some good in that big hulk of a fellow," was what he
said aside to Mark, who was also watching Matt.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the other, "I kind of had my doubts
when you said all that, but the way things look now, I'm
beginning to believe there may be a heap of truth in your
theory. But then, everybody can't see as far as you can,
Elmer. That's the truth of it. Most of us just skim along
the surface, but seems like you dig down deep. I hope it
turns out that way. If Matt Tubbs changed his nature,
and began to do the right thing, it'd be the best job ever
for the boys of Fairfield, because you know he's the big
boss over there. And say, wouldn't it make our chance for
a warm session of baseball a little later on look pretty
good?"</p>

<p>"That's a fact," declared Lil Artha, who had joined
them in time to catch what was being said. "That Matt
Tubbs sure is a crack-a-jack when it comes to playing ball,
and the nine he had last year was as stiff a proposition as
the Hickory Ridge fellows ever tackled. Yes, siree, I certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hope he'll be on the square after this; because it'd mean
a lot for us."</p>

<p>Matt himself must have heard what they were saying,
for at this juncture he turned and grinned as he remarked:</p>

<p>"Just you wait and see what comes out o' this, Lil
Artha. I've got a hunch it's time the Fairfield fellers
get busy and ketch up with your crowd. And mark my
words, once we get started, you've got to do your level best
to climb up out of our reach, for we c'n go some, we Fairfield
fellers. I got a few idees since hitchin' up with this
crowd. There's goin' to be some changes right away, and
Hickory Ridge has got to look out, if she don't want to
be beat at her own game. Yes, sir, this ain't goin' to be
the only troop of scouts around here. There's another town
on the map&mdash;and they call her Fairfield!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LENDING A HELPING HAND.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> comes Red, now," said Mark, about ten minutes
later, and presently the party mentioned came hurrying
up to the door of the log cabin, on which he beat a
loud tattoo.</p>

<p>"Open up here, fellows!" he called. "Danger's
passed. Both those tramps are just legging it out of this
section to beat the band. Reckon they're more'n a mile
off right now. My! but they're scared. Won't stop runnin'
for the next hour. It was as good as a circus to see
'em talkin', when they just couldn't find me out. Must
'a' begun to think it was one of Chatz's ghosts right out of
the graveyard."</p>

<p>"Now, just you drop that subject, Red," remarked the
Southern lad, aggressively. "It's nobody's business what
I believe in, suh, and I'd thank you to keep your opinions
to yourself. I reckon now that everyone has his failings,
and if mine happen to be a belief in spirits that's my affair,
suh. That's all foh you, Red."</p>

<p>"What're we going to do next, Elmer?" demanded
Toby.</p>

<p>"Head for home," replied the leader, promptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Matt Tubbs, "Ruth's ma will be countin'
the minutes till we get there, I reckon. If she's tuckered
out, the little gal I mean, fellers, just let me carry her."</p>

<p>"Oh! we all can take a turn at that," remarked Lil
Artha. "She's only a featherweight, and there ain't one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of us but what would want to have a hand in toting her
back. Let's be starting, boys!"</p>

<p>"Say, what d'ye mean to do with me?" called Dolph,
who, lying there on the hard earthen floor of the bunk-house,
had been listening to all the talk, and wondering
what he had better do to further his own interests.</p>

<p>Elmer, followed by several of the scouts, sauntered over
to him.</p>

<p>"I was just trying to make up my mind," he said,
"whether we had better take you along with us and hand
you over to the police, or leave you here, and send them
after you."</p>

<p>"What's the use doin' either?" remarked the man,
eagerly. "Turn me loose and see me skip out of this
section like a scared rabbit."</p>

<p>But Elmer was not in the least inclined to take that
view of the matter. Dolph had a hard face. He had
proven himself a cruel rascal. Elmer remembered the way
he had shaken little Ruth, and all sense of pity for the
man's condition was banished from his heart.</p>

<p>"That would suit you, I suppose, from the ground up,"
he remarked; "but it would be a bad job for other people.
Besides, I promised the police that if we were lucky enough
to get our hands on you we'd hold you. Here, that'll do
now, Dolph Gruber; if you keep up that kind of talk we'll
muzzle you. I've seen men gagged before now, and know
how it's done. And I give you my word it doesn't feel the
finest thing in the world, either. Not another word or you
get it!"</p>

<p>The prisoner had formed an opinion of the young scout
master. He believed that it would be silly in the extreme
to anger him, and so, grumbling, and gritting his teeth, he
allowed them to do what they wished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>His ankles having been unfastened, Dolph was told to
get up, one of the scouts assisting him at the same time.</p>

<p>"Here, Lil Artha," said the commander, "pick out
three other fellows who have clubs as good as that one you
carry. Form around the prisoner, and act as his escort.
If he tries to escape you know what to do without my
telling."</p>

<p>"Say, just let him give us the least excuse for treating
him to a dose, that's all. I saw him cuff that little girl,
and it showed what a big brute he is. Don't I just hope
he'll try to break away!"</p>

<p>Dolph gave the speaker, no other than Ty Collins, a dark
scowl, but he did not dare express what was passing in his
mind.</p>

<p>So they left the logging camp. Lil Artha, who was
recognized as the official photographer of the troop, managed
to snap off several views that at future times would
recall the picture of that memorable occasion, and doubtless
give them the greatest of pleasure.</p>

<p>And Mark, who was really the grandson of a famous
artist, and himself a genius with a brush and crayons,
would, when the humor seized him, dash off some faithful
sketches showing the passage of the eight boys through that
woodchuck tunnel, and the surprise of Dolph at discovering
them trailing across the floor of the shanty.</p>

<p>At first little Ruth walked bravely along, holding the
hand of her cousin. But presently she disclosed signs of
being weary, and Matt hastened to pick her up in his stout
arms.</p>

<p>When half a mile had been passed over he showed that
the burden was telling on him, for the way was rough.
Thereupon one of the others insisted on having a chance
to do the carrying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Ruth had become firmly convinced that all
these boys were her best of friends, and she did not hesitate
to clasp her chubby arms around the neck of Ty Collins,
Matty Eggleston, Red Huggins, and even Lil Artha, as in
succession they took charge of her.</p>

<p>The march was along the old dirt road that in the end
must bring them to one where the walking would be better.
Elmer conducted the campaign. He knew just how the land
lay, for he had made it a part of his business to draw a
map of the entire country around Hickory Ridge, from
such sources as he could get hold of; and hence there was
not the slightest danger of their getting lost in the timber.</p>

<p>He also sent out several of the boys to act in the capacity
of skirmishers. They were to keep a bright lookout for
any signs of the enemy, meaning the two tramps, and
should they discover them, certain signals&mdash;the scream of
the eagle, or the odd little bark of the beaver perhaps&mdash;would
convey the intelligence to the main company, placing
them on their guard.</p>

<p>But there was no such alarm. Evidently, just as the
sagacious and observing Red had declared, Pete and his tall
ally had hastened to get away with all speed, and for aught
the boys knew might be running yet.</p>

<p>So in good time the expedition finally came to where the
old logging road joined another, that seemed to lead toward
the home town.</p>

<p>"How much further do we have to go now?" asked
Toby, seeing Elmer examining his home-made map.</p>

<p>"A good five miles before us, but all over decent roads,"
smiled the leader.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that ain't so much for scouts as seasoned as
we are," remarked Toby, who had been limping for a little
while, though he declared it was simply on account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
having struck his toe against a root, and not because he
was tired a single bit. "But if I had them wings of mine
here now, p'raps I could take a little flap or two that'd
help along. Reckon they're goin' to work, fellers. Anyhow,
my parachute, she's just a hummer. I'm goin' to
try her out right soon; might climb up on top the church
steeple and jump, if they'll let me."</p>

<p>"Say, boys," remarked Red, just then, "it sure was
a great shame the people that owned the old balloon we
picked up when we were camping up on Lake Solitary
claimed the gas bag, and insisted on paying us twenty-five
dollars for saving their property. I'd like to wager that
by now our inventive comrade here, Toby Ellsworth Jones,
would have coaxed his ma to pay for having it filled with
gas, and gone sailing off to the land of the moon, or somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh! I had that all laid out," grinned Toby, "and I
wasn't goin' to beg a single cent from my ma, either.
Could 'a' caught all the hot air I needed by just grabbin'
what was goin' to waste in this bunch when they got to disputin'.
But I ain't cast down a bit, fellers. Plenty more
chances for a really bright genius to make his mark in the
world of science. If I live, the name of Jones will go
thundering down the ages. Since the days of John Paul
in Revolutionary times, not a single Jones has done anything
worth mentionin'. But the time's near at hand when
you'll hear somethin' drop!"</p>

<p>"Huh! that'll be you, then, Toby," chuckled Red, "if
you try to jump off a church steeple with your old wings
on. And I reckon there'll be something of a splash, too!
Better go slow, that's what."</p>

<p>Talking in this vein, and joking with one another, the
scouts managed to put the long miles behind them. Nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
every fellow had had a chance to carry little Ruth more
or less, and seemed only too proud of the opportunity.</p>

<p>"I c'n see the church spire!" shouted Phil Dale, finally.</p>

<p>"He's right, boys," remarked Elmer, who had seen the
same thing, off and on, for the last five minutes, though
waiting to discover whether any of the others would pick
it up. "We're going to be home soon now. Here comes
a car after us, and as sure as anything, it's got the Hickory
Ridge police force in it! Line up along the road, boys,
and watch how they stare."</p>

<p>When those in the car saw little Ruth among the scouts,
and also noted that they had the kidnaper, Dolph, in custody,
they gave the boys a hearty cheer. Some of them
wanted to take the child in the car, but Elmer declined to
allow it.</p>

<p>"We've done all the work, and we ought to be on hand
when the girl is given over to her mother," he said.
"That's all the reward we want for our day's labor, and
say, we've had just a dandy time, haven't we, fellows?"</p>

<p>A roar answered him, every scout taking off his hat, and
waving it as he gave vent to three lusty cheers. Seeing
the justice of this claim, those in the car declared they
would fall in behind. It was known that Mrs. Gruber had
remained in her little cottage home, so toward that quarter
the procession started.</p>

<p>And when they saw the great joy that filled that poor
mother's heart as she clasped her darling girl in her arms,
every scout felt amply repaid for what fatigue he had endured
that day. It was well worth the labor. And besides,
had they not learned many things in the way of woodcraft
that were apt to be useful, and make them better
scouts?</p>

<p>Elmer was a proud boy when the mother of little Ruth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
took his hand and squeezed it between both of her own,
while she poured out thanks for what he had done. He
quickly assured her that every one of those with him deserved
just as much praise, and then laughed to see how
confused some of the fellows looked when the happy and
grateful mother went the rounds, actually kissing every fellow,
just as if they might be her own boys!</p>

<p>Matt Tubbs came over to him just as the scouts were
drawing together, with the idea of returning to town, having
had all the hike they desired for that one particular
day.</p>

<p>"Oh! by the way, Matt," said Elmer with a twinkle in
his eye, "the first time you're in Hickory Ridge, just
stop off at my house, won't you? I think I've got a cap
of yours, a gray one, with a little red button in the front."</p>

<p>Matt turned slightly red himself, and then laughed.</p>

<p>"Say, I acknowledge the corn, Elmer," he remarked.
"I was in that old shop, all right, listenin' to what you fellers
said. Just wanted to know how you ran things so's
I could foller suit. Picked up a heap, too, you bet. But
the blamed old loft was so rotten she just went through,
and let me down with a whoop. Some of your scouts nigh
got a grip on me when I run away. But they ain't goin'
to ketch Matt Tubbs asleep any more'n they will a weasel.
No harm done, Elmer, was there?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, Matt," replied the young scout master,
heartily. "Glad you heard all you did, and if we can help
you organize a troop over in Fairfield, just you call on the
Hickory Ridge scouts. Hear that, Matt?"</p>

<p>The bully of Fairfield looked steadily at the leader of the
Wolf Patrol; then he laughed a little as he replied:</p>

<p>"Mebbe I will, Elmer, for you've sure got me guessing
some; mebbe I will!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>That Matt Tubbs was as good as his word about getting
up a troop of scouts in Fairfield, and what interesting
events were bound to occur in the natural rivalry between
the two organizations, will be recorded in the future volumes
of this series, the next one of which will be called
"The Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts Pathfinder."</p>

<h2>THE TREES OF THE UNITED STATES.</h2>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Witch Hazel Family.</span></div>

<p>The Witch Hazel is a little tree or shrub of striking
growth that, when all its neighbors are getting ready for
their long winter nap, bursts out in full bloom with
clusters of stringy yellow flowers, at the same time bearing
the ripened seed pods of last year's blossoms. The
seeds have a peculiar way of popping from the pods.
Take some home with you in the late fall and see what
happens. As soon as the pods feel the warmth of the
room they burst and shoot out the seeds. It is said that
the Indians used the bark of the witch hazel in treating
inflammation, and it is still popularly believed to contain
healing virtue.</p>

<p>The Sweetgum or Liquidambar is a tree that grows
widely over the United States. Its leaves are star-shaped
and not unlike the leaves of the maple. The coloring of
the Liquidambar in the fall is very beautiful. Its fruit
is a peculiar little spiny ball. The gum was used by the
Indians to sweeten their smoking mixtures. In some sections
it is called the Alligator Tree because of the peculiarity
of the bark.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Dogwood Family.</span></div>

<p>The Flowering Dogwood is the most beautiful sight of
our May woodlands. The wood of this tree is very hard.
Nobody seems to know how it received its common name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
It is covered with clusters of red berries in the fall and
at that time its leaves turn a bright red.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Olive Family.</span></div>

<p>To this family belong the Ash trees, so called on account
of the appearance of the under-surface of their leaves.
There is a superstition that the ash tree is peculiarly
likely to be struck by lightning. Its wood is largely used
because of its lightness and elasticity; such articles as the
handles of tools, oars, and carriage shafts are made of ash
wood. White ash sometimes grows very tall; the black
ash favors rivers and swamp-land and is not of such a
sturdy growth as the white. The fruit of both form in
clusters.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Bignonia Family.</span></div>

<p>The Catalpa in June or July is covered with white
blossoms mottled with yellow and purple. It is often
called "The Bean Tree" because its fruit is like a long
bean in form. These beans hang on a tree nearly all
winter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Oak Family.</span></div>

<p>This is one of the handsomest of our tree families.
The common white oak grows to a height of eighty to one
hundred feet, the trunk often reaching a diameter of four
feet. The leaves of the chestnut oak and those of the
yellow oak resemble the leaves of the chestnut tree. The
acorns of the red oak are very large, but the kernels are
so bitter that the squirrels leave them untouched upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the ground. The leaves of the scarlet oak are very finely
cut and assume brilliant colors in the late fall. There are
many other varieties of oaks: straggling little scrub oaks,
laurel oaks with laurel-like leaves, and the willow oaks of
the Southwestern states.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Beech Family.</span></div>

<p>The Indians believed that the beech tree was lightning-proof,
and many farmers seem to favor this belief. The
Chestnut, which belongs in this group, does not flower
until the middle of the summer. Unfortunately for the
latter tree, a disease is spreading through certain districts
that, if not checked, bids fair to exterminate these
trees. Already in certain parts of the country where chestnuts
formerly abounded hardly a living specimen is to be
found, or if alive, is in a dying condition.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Elm Family.</span></div>

<p>This is a family of beautiful trees, widely distributed.
The white elm is one of the first trees to respond to
spring's first warm days. Its tiny flower buds burst their
scales and shed them to the ground. It is without question
one of the most beautifully shaped trees, and many
reach vast proportions. The Slippery Elm is similar in
appearance to the white elm. The bark of the latter tree
is soaked in water and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'drank'">drunk</ins> for throat affections. The
leaves of the elms turn yellow in the fall. Their wood is
largely used for carriage shafts or wherever wood that
does not readily split is needed. It is durable under water,
and is, therefore, used for docks and piles.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Linden Family.</span></div>

<p>These are known in this country as basswood or white-wood;
in Europe they are called Lime Trees. Their leaves
are heart-shaped and the lower surface is downy. The
bees are attracted to these trees when they are in bloom.
They can easily be recognized in winter by their red buds.
The first leaves of spring are a bright green which contrast
beautifully with these buds. The wood is used for
cabinet work, woodenware and paper pulp. It does not
easily warp.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Magnolia Family.</span></div>

<p>This is a group of trees whose flowers are usually large
and white, green, or pink in color. Some of this family
are cultivated as ornamental trees on lawns. The Swamp
Magnolia, or Sweet Bay, grows in swampy and damp places.
Although specially a southern tree, it is found as far north
as Massachusetts. It blooms in June, having a cream-color<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
fragrant flower, and these blossoms are sold by florists and
street pedlars.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Tulip Tree or Yellow Poplar is a large tree of this family
that blooms especially abundantly upon the southern
shores of Lake Erie. It has greenish-yellow, tulip-shaped
flowers. The Indians made their dugout canoes from these
trees.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Maple Family.</span></div>

<p>There are more than one hundred species of this family.
Maples are especially abundant in North America. The
Sugar Maple grows in eastern North America. From its
sap is manufactured maple sugar. The method of making
this sugar was learned by the American colonists from
the Indians. In the early spring, when this sap begins to
flow, and while it is flowing, the trees are tapped, the sap
gathered and boiled down. Certain varieties of maple-wood
have beautifully spotted grain known as Bird's-eye
Maple. This grain, it is claimed, is produced by wounds
made by woodpeckers. This wood is prized for the manufacture
of furniture. The Red Maple is found growing
along the edges of streams. It is covered in the spring
with tufts of crimson flowers and its foliage is a brilliant
red in the autumn. The leaves of the Silver Maple show
no reds in the fall, but are a uniform yellow. The Canadians
have adopted the maple leaf as their national
emblem.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Horse Chestnut Family.</span></div>

<p>The Horse Chestnut is a native of Asia. In May or
June it is covered with upright spikes of white blossoms.
The Buck-eye is the native Horse Chestnut. The leaves
of the Buck-eye are five-fingered, while those of the tree
commonly called the Horse Chestnut are seven-fingered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Ohio is called the "Buck-eye" state and is named after
this tree.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Mulberry Family.</span></div>

<p>The leaves of the mulberry are broad, the flowers small.
The leaves of the white mulberry are the food of silkworms.
The Indian women used the fiber of the mulberry
to make garments, baskets, and matting; the Japanese
and Chinese manufactured paper from its bark. The
red mulberry is quite common and grows in over two-thirds
of the United States. The fruit is similar in
appearance to the blackberry; the white mulberry is less
widely distributed. The osage orange, or bow-wood, which
is a member of this family, grows in Arkansas, Texas, and
Indian Territory. Its fruit resembles the orange in shape
and size; its leaves are shiny and it is close and spiny in
growth.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Plane Tree Family.</span></div>

<p>The common Plane is another tree from the Orient; the
flowers are green, the fruit are yellow balls which hang
on the tree over winter. It grows in rich, moist lands;
the wood, which is ruddy in color, is used extensively in
the manufacture of cigar boxes. It is also called the
sycamore or buttonwood, and is easily distinguished by
its bark, which it sheds as it does the leaves; the bark
drops off in large irregular pieces, giving the tree a mottled
appearance.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Walnut Family.</span></div>

<p>The Black Walnut is abundant in the Mississippi Valley
states, especially the Middle states. The White Walnut is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the Butternut; the covering of the nut is sticky and
gummy.</p>

<img src="images/i-05.png" width="283" height="400" alt="SHELL-BARK HICKORY." title="" />
<span class="caption">SHELL-BARK HICKORY.</span>
</div>

<p>The Hickory, which belongs to this family, is an American
tree; none of the hickories are found abroad. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Bitternut, or Swamp Hickory, has a kernel which is very
bitter. The bark of the Shell-bark Hickory separates and
gives the trunk of the tree a very shaggy, unkempt appearance.
The Pignut is a Hickory, but is worthless as
food. The wood of the walnut was formerly much used
for the manufacture of furniture.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Birch Family.</span></div>

<p>This is an interesting family of graceful trees. The
white birch, which is the least common, is short-lived. It
grows from the St. Lawrence southward to Delaware. The
leaves have a peculiar trembling characteristic. The Paper
Birch is also called the white birch or canoe birch. It
is fond of moist places. Its bark is white outside and
composed of thin layers easily separated; these layers vary
in color from a cream to a bright orange-yellow. The
Indians used the bark of this tree for their canoes and to
write their messages on. The red birches are great lovers
of water, particularly delighting to hang their boughs
over running streams. The alders and ironwoods belong
here.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Willow Family.</span></div>

<p>This is a large tree family; the black willow may be
found growing upon the banks of streams and lakes. In
the early spring days we gather pussy willows. They
are really the flower buds. Put them in water and watch
the catkins, as the flowers are called, develop. The Weeping
Willow is a native of Asia; it grew near ancient
Babylon. You will remember that the Bible tells us that
the people of Israel hung their harps upon the willow
tree by the waters of Babylon. They are trees of rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
growth, as are also the aspens and cottonwoods. The last-named
trees derive their name from the peculiarity of the
seed, which is surrounded by cotton-like fiber. The leaves
of the aspen tremble even on calm days and have given
rise to the saying, "trembling like an aspen leaf." An
old tradition says that the leaves of this tree are never at
rest because aspen wood was used in making the cross.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Sumach Family.</span></div>

<p>One of this family is poisonous and is known as poison
sumach. It grows throughout the Northern states and can
be distinguished from the harmless sumach by its white
fruit, the color of the fruit of other sumachs being red,
and the fact that it likes wet ground, while its harmless
cousins like dry places. To some persons the action of
the sumach poison is virulent, causing painful itching
eruptions similar to those caused by poison ivy.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Pea Family.</span></div>

<p>The Locust is a tall tree, native to this country, flowering
profusely in May and June, being at that time nearly
covered with long, hanging clusters of fragrant white blossoms.
A small tree, called the Red Bud, or Judas Tree,
belongs to this family. It is often used as ornamental
trees in parks and on lawns. In Arkansas it grows in
native abundance. The flowers, which are a deep rose
color, appear in April or May, about the time that the
young leaves are putting in an appearance. They are
borne all over the tree, even on the trunk itself. The
Honey Locust has large, finer foliage than the common
locust and it is armored and protected by a multitude of
sharp thorns. The locust wood is much used in ship-building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and fence posts because it resists decay in contact
with moisture. It is very strong, hard, and takes a
high polish. These trees are now preyed upon by boring
insects and are not as popular as they were formerly.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Rose Family.</span></div>

<p>What boy of the New England or the Middle states does
not know the Choke Cherry or Wild Cherry and its fruit
that he gathers and eats, although it puckers his mouth?
Did you know that these, as well as our cultivated cherries,
apples, pears, quinces, and plums, all belong to the same
flower family that gives us our roses? The Mountain Ash
also belongs to this family. Red Ash Berries help to
brighten up the autumn and winter; in fact, these trees
are so attractive when in fruit that they are being largely
used for decorative purposes. In Europe they are called
the Rowan Trees, and many peculiar tales and superstitions
have gathered around them.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class='smcap'>The Pine Family.</span></div>

<p>The pines of the United States include many species,
most of which are valuable for their timber. The White
Pine, which attains a great height and favors sandy soil,
heads the list. Its bark is smoother than any other pine
and its cones are long and slender. Its wood is soft, compact,
and valuable. The wood of the Yellow Pine is hard
and heavy, darker in tone, and much favored for flooring.
It does not grow to such a height as the white pine; it is
found throughout the Southern states. The Red Pine, or
Norway Pine, favors Canada more than our country. The
Pitch Pine grows in sandy and rocky soil or in the cold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
swampy lands. The Jersey, or Scrub Pine, grows on
sandy soil.</p>

<p>The Spruces have brighter leaves than the pines and the
leaves are not grouped like the pine leaves. The leaves
are borne on drooping branches; the cones are pendent;
the white spruce grows higher than any other spruce. The
cones of the red spruce are large; the resin of both the
red and black spruces are used as chewing gum.</p>

<p>The Hemlock is one of the most graceful of cone-bearing
trees. The hemlocks grow rapidly and become very rugged
and picturesque. Hemlock wood warps when exposed; its
bark is used in tanning. The leaves of the balsam are a
bright green color above and a silver green color below.
They are dried and made into pillows because of their
fragrance. Arborvit&aelig;, or White Hemlock, is cultivated
as an ornamental tree. It is much used for hedges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Spring Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>White.</i></div>


<p>Go into the woods some day early in April and you will
find, pushing up through the last summer's litter, a curled-up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
leaf. Open this leaf and nestling within will be a
white flower bud. Even when in bloom the leaf surrounds
the flower stem as though to protect it. As you pick the
flower a red juice oozes out of the stem and stains your
hands. This is the blood root and the Indians used its
juice to stain their faces. Just beyond it, bending and
nodding in the wind, is the dainty little anemone; there is
sometimes a hint of pink or lavender in its white flowers.</p>

<p>Among the rocks you will find, swinging, the little
Dutchman's Breeches, with their peculiar little flowers that
look like pairs of trousers hung on a line. Growing with
it will be the saxifrage, whose name means that it breaks
rocks. This name was probably given to it because it is
usually found growing in the clefts of rocks. As spring
advances, the woods are dotted with bright little star flowers
and the unpleasantly odorous May apple and the white
Trillium with its three long petals. The feathery baneberry
is in flower when the columbine blooms and when
the green-and-brown Jacks-in-the-Pulpit are preaching in
the woods. The Jack-in-the-Pulpit in shape is not unlike
a calla lily.</p>

<p>If you will go down into the swampy meadowland you
will find the bright, sturdy marsh marigolds, and in the
wet woods adjoining the spice bushes glowing with their
fussy little yellow blossoms, and alongside the brook the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
dog-toothed violet or yellow adder's tongue, rearing their
mottled leaves and nodding their yellow blossoms. These
are not violets at all, by the way, but lilies. In the May
woods are the red and yellow flowers of the Wood Betony
and the bell-shaped flowers of Solomon's Seal. Pull up
the Solomon's Seal root and see the marks on it that look
like the impression of a seal. That is how it received its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
name, although why "Solomon's Seal" we are unable to
answer. Bellwort is a little yellowish lily common in the
May woods.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Spring Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>Pink.</i></div>

<p>In company with the blood root and dog-toothed violets
and the dainty anemones are the pretty little pink-veined
Spring Beauties, with their slender leaves and graceful
stems. Lucky are you if you chance to live where the
trailing arbutus grows, with its deliciously perfumed waxy
flowers under last summer's dead leaves. The New Englanders
call it the May Flower. The attractive blossoms
of the Rhodora brighten the woods with their splendor.
This is a wild Rhododendron and belongs to the same
family as the wild honeysuckle that blossoms in the moist
places in May.</p>

<p>Other pink spring flowers:</p>

<p>Heading this list comes the Columbine, and if you will
gather this flower you must be prepared to climb, for it
is fond of nooks and crannies difficult to reach. Starting
up from three broad leaves the little flower of the Wake
Robin thrusts itself upon our attention; it is not shy or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

<p>First of the blues comes the fuzzy-stemmed and fuzzy-budded
hepatica, which is known also by the ugly name
of "liverwort." Sometimes the flowers fade to a white,
sometimes to a pinkish lavender. The one symbol of
springtime is the violet. When the violet comes we know
that winter has gone for good. The wild geranium or
cranebill grows and blossoms sturdily when the anemones
and Spring Beauties are getting scarce.</p>

<p>Other blue and purple spring flowers:</p>

<p>Bluets or Quaker Ladies&mdash;Meadows and roadsides.</p>

<p>Larkspur&mdash;Not found east of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Cancer Root&mdash;Wet woods.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Early Summer Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>White.</i></div>

<p>Early in June you will see in the woods and fields a
shrub that looks like a young maple tree blooming abundantly
with clusters of white flowers. It is the Dockmackie,
or the Maple-leaved Viburnum. If you live on
the hills of the Hudson or Pennsylvania you will have the
opportunity yearly of seeing the Mountain Laurel in
flower, a shrub that is cultivated and highly esteemed in
England. The stamens of the flowers are caught in little
pockets, and as the insect alights on these they are loosened
and fly upward, shaking the pollen on to the body
of the insect.</p>

<p>Blooming in the same location may be found the Wild
Rhododendron, which belongs to the same family as the
Mountain Laurel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Another member of this family is the Swamp Honeysuckle
or the Clammy Azalea; both of these are shrubs.
The latter is usually found among the swampy coast lands.</p>

<p>Still another member of this heath family, to which the
Mountain Laurel and Rhododendron belong, is the Little
Shin Leaf, with its Lily-of-the-Valley-like flowers. Growing
alongside of it you are very likely to find the Pipsissewa,
with its beautiful perfume and ever-green leaves.
June is the month when the meadows are whitened by the
daisies.</p>

<p>Other early summer white flowers:</p>

<p>Wood Sorrel&mdash;June woods.</p>

<p>Sweet Cicely&mdash;Sweet-tasting root.</p>

<p>Marsh Andromeda&mdash;Swampy places.</p>

<p>Staggerbush&mdash;Low dry places.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Early Summer Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>Yellow.</i></div>

<p>In May or June hunt for the Yellow Lady Slipper or
Whip-poor-Will's Shoe, a pretty little yellow Orchid. Mr.
Baldwin, writing of orchids of New England, says: "Its
preference is for maples, beeches, and particularly butternuts,
and for sloping or hilly ground, and I always look
with glad suspicion at a knoll covered with ferns, cohoshes,
and trilliums, expecting to see a clump of this plant among
them. Its sentinel-like habit of choosing 'sightly places'
leads it to venture well up on mountain-sides."</p>

<p>The straggly flower heads of the Hawk Weed, or Rattlesnake
Weed, that looks like little Dandelions, will be found
in the dry pine woods at this time of the year. Its leaves
are veined with purple and thought to resemble the markings
of the rattlesnake. This has given it its name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>We need no introduction to the common dandelion that
carpets our lawns with a cloth of gold, much to the disgust
of the gardener, who roots them out as weeds.</p>

<p>Another flower of the waste places is a pretty little toad
flax, or butter-and-eggs. It is probably called "butter-and-eggs"
because of the two shades of yellow. Its juice,
mixed with milk, makes a good fly poison.</p>

<p>In the same localities may be found the St. John's Wort,
with its numerous little flowers, and both the moth mullein
and common mullein. The old Romans used to dip the
dry stalk of the common mullein in fat and use it as a
torch. The moth mullein is tenderer than the common
mullein. The flowers are tipped with red and purple.</p>

<p>Other early summer yellow flowers:</p>

<p>Cinquefoil&mdash;Fields and roadsides.</p>

<p>Bush Honeysuckle&mdash;Hillsides.</p>

<p>Four-leaved Loosestrife&mdash;Roadsides.</p>

<p>Yellow Loosestrife&mdash;Wet places.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Early Summer Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>Pink.</i></div>

<p>The Pink Lady Slipper, like the Yellow, is another
orchid. Baldwin, to whom we have referred before, tells
us where he usually found them; he says: "The finest
specimens I ever saw sprang out of a cushion of crisp
reindeer moss high up among the rocks of the exposed
hillside, and again I have found it growing vigorously in
hills upon swamps, but nearly colorless from excessive
moisture." He further says that "A lady who has found
it in the Adirondacks says she found it to have a great
fondness for decaying wood and often saw a whole row
perched like birds along a crumbling log."</p>

<p>A smaller laurel with dark pink flowers blooms in June.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
It is called "Lamb-killer," because of the belief that it
is poisonous to sheep.</p>

<p>Corydalis&mdash;Rocky woods.</p>

<p>Adder's Mouth&mdash;Swamps.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Early Summer Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>Red.</i></div>

<p>Thoreau writes: "The Painted Cup is in its prime. It
reddens the meadow, painted cup meadow. It is a splendid
show of brilliant scarlet, the color of the cardinal
flower and surpasses it in mass and profusion. I do not
like the name; it does not remind me of a cup, rather of
a flame when it first appears. It might be called 'flame
flower' or 'scarlet tip.' Here is a large meadow full of
it, and very few in the town have ever seen it. It is
startling to see a leaf thus brilliantly painted, as if its tip
were dipped into some scarlet mixture, surpassing most
flowers in intensity of color."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Early Summer Flowers</span>&mdash;<i>Blue and Purple.</i></div>

<p>The Blue-eye Grass, which belongs to the same family
as the Blue Flag, carpets the moist meadows at this season
of the year. The Blue Flag and Fleur-de-lis is the
flower of France; the name "Fleur-de-lis," the flower of
Louis, King Louis VII having chosen it as his particular
badge. Look for it in damp meadow grounds in June.</p>

<p>Early in June the wild lupine blooms, painting the hillside
blue.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Summer</span>&mdash;<i>White.</i></div>

<p>If you go into the woods where the evergreens grow in
July you will find the Little Wintergreen in bloom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Later in the year you will find the little red Wintergreen
berries. Along the roadside you will find the daisy-like
flowers of the Chamomile or May Weed. From the leaves
of this plant our grandmothers used to make Chamomile
tea.</p>

<p>A shrub that you will find in bloom in the July woods
is the New Jersey Tea, with its clusters of feathery flowers.
At the time of the American Revolution our forefathers
used its leaves to make a substitute for the imported
tea on which Great Britain imposed a tax.</p>

<p>Another flower of the summer woods and hillsides is the
Cohosh, with a stem from three to eight feet high. Its
odor is supposed to be distasteful to insects. The Elders
are a mass of white blossoms at this time of the year, and
later crowned with purplish berries from which elderberry
wine is made.</p>

<p>A common plant of the July roadsides is the Pokeweed.
Its flowers are less conspicuous than its fruit. It has
long clusters of dark berries. Country boys make "ink"
from the juice of these berries.</p>

<p>The Boneset is another wayside flower. Our grandmothers
made boneset tea from its leaves when we were
in danger of colds or malaria. Its flowers are dull white;
it belongs to the same family as the Golden-rod.</p>

<p>Other summer white flowers:</p>

<p>Thimbleweed&mdash;Woods and meadows.</p>

<p>White Avens&mdash;Edges of woods.</p>

<p>Wild Cucumber&mdash;Along river banks.</p>

<p>Yarrow&mdash;Roadsides.</p>

<p>No article on wild flowers of the United States would
be complete without mention of "Queen Anne's Lace,"
while some call it "Bird's Nest," from the habit of the
curling up of the old flowers into a nest-like shape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Summer</span>&mdash;<i>Yellow.</i></div>

<p>One of the most conspicuous yellow flowers is the
Meadow Lily, or the Wild Yellow Lily.</p>

<p>The St. John's Wort is a common flower of this season
of the year. It seems to flourish in the waste places, while
both the moth mullein and the common mullein are close
companions.</p>

<p>When the white daisies are beginning to wane, the yellow
daisies or Black-eyed Susans begin to bloom. The Jewel
Weed is also called by some "Touch-me-Not," on account
of the few seed pods, which burst when touched, showing
the seeds.</p>

<p>At twilight and in the early morning the Evening Primrose
opens its dull yellow blossoms. During the middle
of the day the flowers are closed.</p>

<p>Other summer yellow flowers:</p>

<p>Yellow Clover&mdash;Fields and roadsides.</p>

<p>Bladderwort&mdash;Ponds and streams.</p>

<p>Partridge Pea&mdash;Sandy Soil.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Summer</span>&mdash;<i>Pink.</i></div>

<p>Probably the foremost among these is the Common Milkweed,
with its dull pink clustered flowers that later turn
into a pod filled with silky fibers, which the children love
to break open and set afloat in the wind. It is called
"Milkweed" on account of the white sticky fluid which it
exhumes from the broken stems.</p>

<p>Along the roadside and meadows purplish-pink flowers
of the Fireweed are in bloom.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful of the pink midsummer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
flowers is the Mallow that makes lively our swamps with
its large pale pink flowers.</p>

<p>Other summer pink flowers:</p>

<p>Steeplebush&mdash;Low places.</p>

<p>Purple Loosestrife&mdash;Marshes.</p>

<p>Meadow Beauty&mdash;Sandy soil.</p>

<p>Tick Trefoil&mdash;Midsummer woods.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Summer</span>&mdash;<i>Red.</i></div>

<p>Two lilies of midsummer are the Wild Lily and the
Turk's Cap Lily; the Turk's Cap Lily, with its drooping
flowers, and the Wild Lily, with its upright flowers, that
grow in our meadows, the Wild Lily in the shady woods.</p>

<p>Here and there in the midsummer fields is a patch of
the bright flame-color orange-red Butterfly Weed. This
belongs to the Milkweed family. They present to the eye
some of the most vivid patches of color of the summer
fields.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Summer</span>&mdash;<i>Blue and Purple.</i></div>

<p>Growing in the waste places from June until September
are the closed heads of the "Self Heal," with its
bluish-purple flowers and the spikes of the dainty little
vervain.</p>

<p>Blooming in midsummer is the aromatic little Pennyroyal,
one of the mint family.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Late Summer and Autumn</span>&mdash;<i>Yellow.</i></div>

<p>Without doubt the one flower that holds the foremost
rank of the late summer and autumn flowers is the
Golden-rod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wild Sunflower and the Bur Marigold, or "Stick-tight,"
belong to the same family as the Golden-rod, the
Composite Family.</p>

<p>Witch-hazel Shrubs are now coming into bloom, blooming
when everything else is getting ready for the winter
nap.</p>

<p>Other late summer yellow flowers:</p>

<p>False Foxgloves&mdash;Dry woodland.</p>

<p>Yellow Thistle&mdash;Sandy coast soil.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Late Summer and Autumn</span>&mdash;<i>White.</i></div>

<p>The Rattlesnake Plantain has peculiar leaves veined with
white. The Indians believed that application of the leaves
of this plant would cure a snake bite.</p>

<p>One of the shrubs that blooms at this season of the
year is the Sweet Pepperbush, which is becoming popular
as a cultivated shrub in our gardens and lawns. It seems
to bloom best in those localities where there is considerable
moisture in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The dry fields are now thickly covered with the white
asters.</p>

<p>Other late summer white flowers:</p>

<p>Ladies' Tresses&mdash;Wet places in autumn.</p>

<p>Pearly Everlasting&mdash;Woods and fields.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Late Summer and Autumn</span>&mdash;<i>Pink.</i></div>

<p>A common roadside flower is the Pink Knotweed, with
its branching stems and groups of bright pink flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">

<span class="caption">PINK KNOTWEED.</span>
</div>

<p>The Bouncing Bet is now growing sturdily, with its
pinkish-white flowers, and close to the Butterfly Weed
blooms the "Joe Pye Weed," with its dusky purplish-pink
clusters, while the Golden-rod and Asters are in flower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Other late summer pink flowers:</p>

<p>Purple Gerardia&mdash;Low dry ground.</p>

<p>False Dragon Head&mdash;Wet fields.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Late Summer and Autumn</span>&mdash;<i>Red.</i></div>

<p>In the late summer, along the edges of ponds and
streams and in the midst of swamps, gleam the bright,
ragged flowers of the Cardinal flower, the brightest red
flower of early autumn.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Late Summer and Autumn</span>&mdash;<i>Blue and Purple.</i></div>

<p>The Blue Chicory or Succory brightens up our roadsides
in late summer when the fields are full of blue and
purple Asters. There are over one hundred different
species of wild Asters, all belonging to the Composite Family,
the same family that the Golden-rod, Daisies, and Sunflowers
are members of. The Composite Family, in fact,
is in majority at this season of the year.</p>

<p>Both the closed and fringed Gentian come to us in late
September, with their beautiful blue flowers&mdash;blue of a
beautiful shade.</p>

<p>Other late summer flowers&mdash;blue and purple:</p>

<p>Blazing Star&mdash;Marsh land.</p>

<p>Iron Weed&mdash;Roadsides and fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
